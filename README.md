# About New Leaf Journal Feeds

This is the repository for New Leaf Journal Feeds. The site, powered by Osmofeed, aggregates RSS feeds from [*The New Leaf Journal*](https://thenewleafjournal.com) and related projects. You can bookmark it to stay abreast of our latest content. You can also find an up-to-date list of *New Leaf Journal* feeds and options for more granular site feeds on [our website](https://thenewleafjournal.com/new-leaf-journal-feeds/). If you want to add any of the feeds to your feed reader, see the [osmofeed.yaml](https://github.com/nafnlj/nlj-feeds/blob/main/osmosfeed.yaml) file in this repository. If you want to make your own GitHub Pages-powered feed reader, see the [Osmocraft's Osmofeed repository](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed).
