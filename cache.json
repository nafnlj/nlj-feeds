However, I published my 2021 review in April 2022. Fresh off my very late 2021 review, I published a short Leaflet post on April 26, 2022, offering my initial impressions of the first quarter and a third of anime in 2022. I quote from my Leaflet:\nMy clear early-frontrunner for anime of the year in 2022 is the excellent third and final season of Teasing Master Takagi-san. The first two seasons were good fun, but neither was quite anime of the year caliber (although the second season …",

My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.",

I use uBlock Origin with Firefox and I also use Thunderbird as my desktop email client (see my article on using Thunderbird with DecSync). I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox. The installation and export worked perfectly, but the non-uBlock Origin filter lists that I have enabled did not update (I am not sure if that is a general issue, but not important in my case).

          "description": "I have watched the first few episodes of a currently airing anime series called My Love Story With Yamada-kun at Lv999. While I have not been impressed thus far, it did inspire an article. The first episode begins with the viewpoint protagonist, Akane, in the dumps after her boyfriend left her for another woman he met in an online game that he played with Akane. There is a scene where Akane opens up her laptop to log into the game. When she turns it on, I noticed a problem.\nHer relationship with her cad of an ex-boyfriend may be over, but her toxic relationship with Windows continues. I suggest she consider a new relationship with Linux.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/leveling-up-yamada-kun-at-lv999-to-linux/\n(Can neither confirm nor deny possibility that Microsoft de-indexing my site from Bing played a role in inspiring this article.)\n#anime #linux #windows #microsoft #humor",

The reasons for our blacklisting/de-indexing appear to be unknown to every other search engine with its own index, including Google, Brave, Mojeek, Yandex, Seznam, InfoTiger, and Marginalia... only Bing.

          "description": "For example, the older model had a 1 GHz dual-core processor, while the new version has a 1.8 GHz quad-core chip. Since the company is tight-lipped about exactly which processors are powering these devices, it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but it sure sounds like the new model should be a bit more responsive.Both models have just 1GB of RAM, but the original InkPad Color had just 16GB of built-in storage, while the new model has twice as much. That said, it seems like the company might have omitted one feature when building the new model: there’s no longer a microSD card reader.\nI have the original PocketBook InkPad color and I generally like it. Most of the improvements in V2 would be welcome (albeit well short of prompting me to upgrade), but dropping the microSD card slot is a bad move.  The article suggests that this may have been done to increase the tablet's water resistance, but I will take the SD card over being able to submerge my e-reader in 2 meters of water.",
