I have two outstanding issues:\nStatus post error when Friends plugin is enabled and Post Kinds is disabled. This is not an immediate issue since I am using both, but any situation wherein one plugin depends on another when the plugins provide different features makes me uncomfortable.\nMicropub plugin does not create an endpoint. This is minor since I do not personally plan to publish much using the Micropub endpoint, but it bothers me. I will need to investigate since I am unsure of the issue. I confirmed IndieAuth, on which Micropub depends, does work.\nNo other major issues at the moment.

A Bodhi forum post led me to a 2018 guide for fixing screen tearing on devices with integrated Intel graphics on a site dedicated to Ubuntu MATE (link). The first step was to run inxi -G to discover information about which version of Intel graphics was in use. Fortunately, my netbook used the exact version (2nd generation) as the example, so all I had to do was some simple copying and pasting. I rebooted and the screen tearing was gone. I linked to an archived version of the guide since this should remain a great resource for fixing screen tearing on older devices with Intel integrated graphics.\n#BodhiLinux #linux",

          "description": "I am using an old LibreBooted ThinkPad as a \"server\"... really more as an always-on Syncthing node. After having some issues with GNU Trisquel (probably my fault), I decided to go with Bodhi Linux 7.0 (I prefer to have a GUI). Installation went perfect but I had an issue with the behavior on sleep. By default, the laptop seems to suspend when I close the lid, which causes wi-fi to shut off.  Since I want it to be an always-on Syncthing node, I obviously need the wi-fi to stay on when I close the laptop. After fumbling for a solution, I read on a forum that the XFCE power manager works outside of XFCE.  That sounded good to me since I use XFCE on my main workstation and I am familiar with its GUI tools. I installed it (no extra dependencies - nice), enabled it, and modified the power settings.  It worked perfectly.  I mark this issue as solved.\n#linux #BodhiLinux #XFCE",

          "description": "The boy-Emperor Romulus Augustulus is often described as the last (Western) Roman Emperor. He abdicated the royal purple to Odoacer on September 4, 476. But there remained another claimant to the title of Western Roman Emperor -- the exiled Julius Nepos, who lived until 480. Who was the last Western Roman Emperor? One year to the day, I wrote an article on this ultimately unimportant question.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/who-was-the-last-western-roman-emperor/\n#RomanEmpire #rome #fallofrome #history #romanhistory",

I have a 2018 model TCL TV that I do not give access to the internet (this one works without any issue, but I don't know if that is true of newer models). My TV is right next to my desktop computer, but in order to reduce noise and power, I bought a cheap Beelink mini PC and set it up with Fedora-GNOME and Kodi. Works very well for simple purposes and can easily handle light games. There are plenty of other (possibly better) solutions to this effect such as SBCs, spare laptops, or more capable mini PCs to handle some newer games. I would prefer using a computer instead of the Smart TV OS even without all of the concerns listed in the original post.",
