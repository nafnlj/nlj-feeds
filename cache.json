          "description": "I reviewed a niche search engine (or more aptly put, Bing front-end) called Peekier in February 2022. My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.",

The extension page on Thunderbird Add-ons states that it works with Thunderbird version 91.0 and higher. I use uBlock Origin with Firefox and I also use Thunderbird as my desktop email client (see my article on using Thunderbird with DecSync). I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox. The installation and export worked perfectly, but the non-uBlock Origin filter lists that I have enabled did not update (I am not sure if that is a general issue, but not important in my case). Consider this a PSA for Thunderbird users. If you want an aesthetic Thunderbird set-up, see my short post on the Two Little Birds theme.",

          "description": "I reviewed a niche search tool called Peekier in February 2022. Peekier, like many \"alternative\" search, was mostly a Bing front-end. However, it came with a strong, straightforward privacy policy (albeit with a bit of Cloudflare required .js to run) and a unique way of presenting search results as preview thumbnails.  However, I discovered the other day that Peekier is no more -- its URL redirects to Kagi Search as of late February.

There is a scene where Akane opens up her laptop to log into the game. When she turns it on, I noticed a problem.\nHer relationship with her cad of an ex-boyfriend may be over, but her toxic relationship with Windows continues. I suggest she consider a new relationship with Linux.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/leveling-up-yamada-kun-at-lv999-to-linux/\n(Can neither confirm nor deny possibility that Microsoft de-indexing my site from Bing played a role in inspiring this article.)\n#anime #linux #windows #microsoft #humor",

          "description": "1954 years to the day (April 16, 69 AD), the Roman Emperor Otho ended his brief reign by his own hand rather than continue in a Civil War for the throne against Vilettlius. Otho's seemingly noble(-ish) end captured the imagination of Roman historians in light of the fact he had previously been noted for his relationship to Nero, having serious debt problems, and seizing the throne by murdering his predecessor in January 69.  I wrote a very long article about the enigmatic life and death of Otho, focusing on comparing four Roman historian accounts and their different opinions on the matter.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/ancient-accounts-on-the-enigmatic-life-and-death-of-emperor-otho/\n#history #romanempire #romanhistory #romanemperor #otho #yearoffouremperors",

          "description": "For example, the older model had a 1 GHz dual-core processor, while the new version has a 1.8 GHz quad-core chip. Since the company is tight-lipped about exactly which processors are powering these devices, it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but it sure sounds like the new model should be a bit more responsive.Both models have just 1GB of RAM, but the original InkPad Color had just 16GB of built-in storage, while the new model has twice as much. That said, it seems like the company might have omitted one feature when building the new model: there’s no longer a microSD card reader.\nI have the original PocketBook InkPad color and I generally like it. Most of the improvements in V2 would be welcome (albeit well short of prompting me to upgrade), but dropping the microSD card slot is a bad move.  The article suggests that this may have been done to increase the tablet's water resistance, but I will take the SD card over being able to submerge my e-reader in 2 meters of water.",
