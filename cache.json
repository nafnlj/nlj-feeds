A Bodhi forum post led me to a 2018 guide for fixing screen tearing on devices with integrated Intel graphics on a site dedicated to Ubuntu MATE (link). The first step was to run inxi -G to discover information about which version of Intel graphics was in use. Fortunately, my netbook used the exact version (2nd generation) as the example, so all I had to do was some simple copying and pasting. I rebooted and the screen tearing was gone. I linked to an archived version of the guide since this should remain a great resource for fixing screen tearing on older devices with Intel integrated graphics.\n#BodhiLinux #linux",

After having some issues with GNU Trisquel (probably my fault), I decided to go with Bodhi Linux 7.0 (I prefer to have a GUI). Installation went perfect but I had an issue with the behavior on sleep. By default, the laptop seems to suspend when I close the lid, which causes wi-fi to shut off.  Since I want it to be an always-on Syncthing node, I obviously need the wi-fi to stay on when I close the laptop. After fumbling for a solution, I read on a forum that the XFCE power manager works outside of XFCE.  That sounded good to me since I use XFCE on my main workstation and I am familiar with its GUI tools. I installed it (no extra dependencies - nice), enabled it, and modified the power settings.  It worked perfectly.  I mark this issue as solved.\n#linux #BodhiLinux #XFCE",

I have a 2018 model TCL TV that I do not give access to the internet (this one works without any issue, but I don't know if that is true of newer models). My TV is right next to my desktop computer, but in order to reduce noise and power, I bought a cheap Beelink mini PC and set it up with Fedora-GNOME and Kodi. Works very well for simple purposes and can easily handle light games.
