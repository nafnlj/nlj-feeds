This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. August is in the books, but I stepped up our publishing pace after a few slow weeks to bring the month to a proper conclusion. Below, I share our week's worth of posts, links from around the web, our new most-visited statistics, and other news and notes.\nLeaves from the week that was\nI published six new articles since mailing Newsletter 150. I suppose that is a decent enough rebound from a one article week (even conceding the month-in-review post only barely counts).\nPumpkin Spice Makeup Removal Wipes: I am no…",

I have two outstanding issues:\nStatus post error when Friends plugin is enabled and Post Kinds is disabled. This is not an immediate issue since I am using both, but any situation wherein one plugin depends on another when the plugins provide different features makes me uncomfortable.\nMicropub plugin does not create an endpoint. This is minor since I do not personally plan to publish much using the Micropub endpoint, but it bothers me. I will need to investigate since I am unsure of the issue. I confirmed IndieAuth, on which Micropub depends, does work.\nNo other major issues at the moment. My ActivityPub profiles briefly stopped working, but I think I fixed that by ensuring that WP Super Cache does not cache author pages.\n#emucafesocial #wordpress #IndieWeb",
