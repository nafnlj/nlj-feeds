It is a story covering a couple of weeks in modern Japan told  from the perspective of three adults (probably in the age 28-30 range). Over the course of the story, we see how the lives of the characters are more connected than they seem. The translation reads very well and the story is clever. I also appreciated the game's visual flair and soundtrack, both of which reminded me a bit of Persona 3.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/collage-visual-novel-review/\n#visualnovel #visualnovels #game #freeware #doujin #japan",

I am writing a long series of articles (now up to 21 reviews!) on old freeware Japanese visual novels that were translated for the 2005, 2006, and 2008 al|together festivals. A reader saw the series and sent a DM about trying to track down the novels. I did not see the DM for about 10 months. However, when I did, I worked with the sender (who is collecting them in a public MEGA Drive) on a couple of games and the interactions led me to track down the Japanese version of Manatsu no Kagerou, which is required for playingg the al|together translation since the English version is a patch.

I would not use it as a primary launcher (I use TinyBit and Kiss would be my second choice), but it functions nicely for a second proposed use case -- an alternative app drawer.  When I need to survey my apps on my LineageOS phone, Keikai is a much more elegant solution than navigating to settings. Moreover, I could see it being very useful on locked down Android-derived devices which do not let the user change his or her default launcher, such as the Kindle Fire line.

          "description": "Several of the spring 2023 anime season series have picked up in their second halves since I expressed by concerns at the half-way point that the first half of 2023 was looking bleak. One of the most interesting (and arguably the best) series of the season is Oshi no Ko, which has achieved great popularity. The series focuses on the entertainment industry in Japan, often in a gritty way. It has impressive production values, but the overall product is inconsistent. One thing it has not failed at is hitting the big moments though. The ends of episodes 1, 7, and 9 are three of the most striking moments of anime in 2023 thus far. 9 was particularly impressive. It was not a surprise when we learned that Kana Arima is a legitimately good singer, but the set-up of her music video and the reactions of her group mates was well-done enough to earn some applause. Of course, unlike my previous three anime series of the year, Oregairu S3, SSSS.Dynazenon, and Teasting Master Takagi-san S3, Oshi no Ko has not put together an entire episode up to the standard of its best scenes. But it is making me think about how much a single scene can carry an episode or how a series of stand-out scenes can define a series. This idea needs more work. It will turn into an article at some point.\n#OshiNoKo #anime #anime2023",

The protagonist, Kyo, came to an important realization. In addition to the story progress, this episode featured some beautiful backgrounds for Kyo's abbreviated vacation. I am curious to see if it resolves key points in its conclusion in the same way that Angel Next Door did last season. Despite the strong finish, the series is held back by a rough start and our lack of insight into Anna's perspective and feelings.\nMy Love Story With Yamada-kun 11\nIt has improved a bit in its second half (having noted that I was not impressed with the first half, and episode 11 offers some hope that something will be resolved in the finale (I have my doubts).  Akane, like Kyo, appears to have come to a realization (albeit she will state it clearly in the next episode).\nMix S2 10\nGranting that I am watching Mix without the benefit of having seen Touch, it continues to meander at a slow pace with surprisingly little baseball action, even compared to season 1. Generally pleasant, but stronger signs in episode 10 that it is going in an unfortunate direction on one of its romantic stories than we had before (not that the signs haven't been there, that is). I did appreciate one scene where the main protagonist, Touma, offered some meta-commentary on people losing interest in slow stories.  The ending song and animation is still fantastic, especially for a show that has a 1980s animation aesthetic.\n#anime #dangersinmyheart #yamadakunat999 #mix-anime",

While I don't need or want Manjaro's GUI tools now, Pamac and its GUI kernel/driver tools helped me make the adjustment from having only used Windows to Linux.
