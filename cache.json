I thought about this when I saw ESPN describe NBA Hall of Famer Tim Duncan as having been born overseas. Duncan was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands. While this is indeed over a sea, the U.S. Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States.  All persons born there are citizens from birth by operation of statute, and it is within the judicial jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. After reflecting on the issue, I concluded, for reasons stated in my article, that Duncan should not be described (from a U.S. perspective) as having been born \"overseas.\"\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/espn-states-tim-duncan-was-born-overseas/\n#definitions #nba #basketball #law #overseas",

I was inspired to write the piece when I saw some dramatically different takes on the animation, ranging from crediting the first 3 minutes for having more frames than entire episodes of other shows to describing those same 3 minutes as being a crime against humanity.  On the whole, I offer some qualified praise for the style and attention to detail while also highlighting technical issues (inconsistent 3D assets, bad shadows, glitches) that are a bit concerning going forward.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/the-girl-i-like-forgot-her-glasses-ep1-animation/\n#anime #animation #gohands #animereview",

The trade, which saw the then-Vancouver Grizzlies trade a future, lightly protected first round pick, for a 35-year old Otis Thorpe nearing the end of his career (note the Grizzlies were coming off a 14-68 season) was so bad that one need not even qualify a critique of the trade with \"hindsight is 20/20.\" Had anyone stopped and thought for a moment, all of the sights would have advised not making that trade.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/1997-otis-thorpe-trade-and-the-2003-nba-draft/\n#nba #basketball #management #stats",

As we know, the Pistons drafted Darko Milicic, who played little in 2.5 seasons with the team, but they won the 2003-04 championship. After considering all the factors, I concluded in a long, stat-filled article, that with perfect hindsight, the Pistons should not have drafted Anthony, but I do offer some alternatives.\n(PS: I was proud of myself when I guessed the championship odds ranking going into 2002-03 and found that the betting odds rank on Basketball Reference matched my guess perfectly.)\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/should-the-pistons-have-drafted-carmelo/\n#nba #basketball #sports #stats",

As one of the three major characters in the dialogue argues -- the purpose is very clearly ritualistic sacrifices to the Founding Fathers (\"argues\" is the operative word).\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/justin-justina-4th-of-july-grill-sacrifices-to-the-spirits-of-the-founders/\n#4thofjuly #independenceday #humor #ushistory #foundingfathers",

          "description": "You may be interested in Osmosfeed: https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed\nIt is a static site feed aggregator primarily designed to go with GitHub Pages. I host one to aggregate my own writing on different sites. I think it may fit your use case because your Osmosfeed site itself outputs a single Atom feed. So, for example, if I have an Osmosfeed site that aggregates feeds 1, 2, and 3, the Osmosfeed site has a single feed which will include the three individual feeds. Mine has about 10-12 feeds and it has worked perfectly thus far with no issues. Not sure if it would have problems at higher numbers.",

I have published more than 800 articles and 350 short-form posts (almost all posts by me, but my friend has published 30something articles). I write about whatever interests me (I tell myself this means there is something for everyone). Common topics include, but are not limited to, tech (digital ownership, open source software, feeds, and my learning Linux), history (usually American or Roman), old books and poems, anime, visual novels (mainly English translations of freeware NScripter/KiriKiri novels), photos from my walks, fictional dialogues, and occasional commentary about life in NYC.\nhttps://memos.emucafe.org/u/2\nI am testing out Memos (https://github.com/usememos/memos) for short-form notes and microblog-style posts, but very much a side project next to NLJ. Neat little tool.",
