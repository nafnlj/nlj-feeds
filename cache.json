          "description": "I use the Ghostwriter markdown editor (see my Ghostwriter review) to draft articles for The New Leaf Journal and briefs and memoranda for my day job as a legal research specialist. In both cases, I have to convert my documents from markdown. I convert New Leaf Journal articles to .odt for editing while I convert my legal work to to .docx. (See my article on my New Leaf Journal workflow.)\nSince switching to Linux in 2020, I have used Arch-based Linux distributions. I began using Ghostwriter on Manjaro after my experiences using markdown to compose \nour Buttondown-powered newsletters inspired me to begin working in markdown. I moved from Manjaro to Arch's closer cousin, EndeavourOS, in August 2022, where I remain today.\nGhostwriter has generally worked for me without issues. Early on, I had an issue with it sometimes not connecting to Pandoc, but that went away at some point. Since KDE took over development of Ghostwriter things were largely flawless. However, a few days ago, I noticed after updating either Pandoc or KDE (I did not catch which) that Ghostwriter was no longer recognizing Pandoc as a conversion option. This was a mild problem for me because I never took the time to learn the Pandoc CLI syntax (I really should get around to that). I could use MultiMarkdown to convert to .odt, but that vitiated many of my markdown formatting choices.\nHowever, before I had to deal with the issue for a work project, Pandoc returned as a conversion option after something was updated. Problem solved. It only proved to be a pain in the case of one somewhat long article wherein I had to re-do some of my formatting in Libre Office Writer.\nIf you enjoy strange Ghostwriter issues, take a trip back in time to learn about a segfault issue I had on a fresh Manjaro install in 2021.",

          "description": "In my previous post, I offered my very early impressions of a free and open source Android feed reader and read-it-later app called Handy Reading. My early impressions were very favorable because, by combining feed reading and read-it-later into a local app, it perfectly suits my reading-flow (see my post on combining feeds with a read-it-later solution). However, I had one pressing issue with Handy Reading:\nHandy Reading re-fetches old, previously seen articles from a small number of feeds, which is a bit annoying.\nTwo days later, I think that I have tentatively resolved the issue. By default, Handy Reading has a short \"keep old articles\" time. It seems that if a feed is offering old articles outside the scope of Handy Reading's kept article time, it will re-fetch those old articles and display them is new even if you have already marked them as read in the app. Fortunately, Handy Reading allows you to set the keep old articles period on a feed-by-feed basis. I have been doing that with the offending feeds and so far the results have been good.\nProvided no new issues pop up, I will try a few additional features of Handy Reading before proceeding to a review. One issue that I am particularly interested in is testing its import/export functionality, since that proved to be an issue with my previous solution -- Flym DecSync. I recently talked to one Mastodon user who reported that Handy Reading does not handle Mastodon feeds, which is true. While I hope this is fixed, it is not a priority for me since I do not use my feed reader for social feeds.",

After going 8th overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, he had a short, uneventful, five-year career with four different teams. While college success by no means guarantees professional success, some of Respert's troubles were linked to the fact he was diagnosed with stomach cancer during his first season (he went into remission in his second season).  What prompted my article was the story of his response. Respert opted to keep his diagnosis secret, not only from the public, but also from his family -- even when he was being criticized in local media for his poor play.  He resolved to only tell his story after his playing career was over in order to ensure that no one could say, succeed or fail, that he made any excuses (to be sure, he had a decent one).\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/playing-through-cancer-in-silence-shawn-resperts-nba-story/\n#nba #basketball #sports #cancer",

          "description": "I describe an interesting (fortunately minor) issue I had with my WordPress caching plugin, WP Super Cache, and disabling two types of lazy loading.  Certain changes or updates seem to restore lazy loading, requiring me to manually flush the cache.  The issue is easy to resolve... fortunately much easier than back in June 2020  when Bluehost (we're no longer with Bluehost) had some terrible server side caching that cached a plugin-cached version of my homepage from a week earlier (that was fun because I had no idea what I was doing in June 2020, I have a 33.4% idea of what I am doing now).\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-super-cache-preload-and-lazy-loading/\n#wordpress #caching #wordpressplugin #blog",

          "description": "I decided to take a stab at writing a couple of anime reviews each season. First up is my excessively long review of The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten, written for both people who haven't watched the series and those who have.  In addition to offering a general (largely spoiler-free) summary and my impressions, I also explain how I think the series should be understood.  Final verdict:  While not without some faults in writing (I  introduce my concept of \"two-by-four story-telling) and production quality control, charming on the whole and better than its absurdly long light novel title would indicate.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/the-angel-next-door-spoils-me-rotten-anime-review/\n#anime #animereview #tenshisama",
