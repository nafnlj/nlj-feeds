The issue was likely tied to a failure to download updates (computer did not have onboard wi-fi, so I was using a cheap Panda Wireless dongle which only supports 2.4 connections). When I tried to go through the installer again, automatic disk partitioning was not available.

However, “free and open source” will likely be a thing of the past after Simple Mobile Tools was acquired by ZippoApps. I used a few Simple Mobile apps back when I wrote a review of F-Droid apps in 2021, but I was fortunately not using any at the time of the ZippoApps news. One of the main contributors to Simple Mobile Tools who was not involved in the decision to sell the suite to an adware company forked the project.
