My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.",

I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox.

          "description": "I use the Ghostwriter markdown editor (see my Ghostwriter review) to draft articles for The New Leaf Journal and briefs and memoranda for my day job as a legal research specialist. In both cases, I have to convert my documents from markdown. I convert New Leaf Journal articles to .odt for editing while I convert my legal work to to .docx. (See my article on my New Leaf Journal workflow.)\nSince switching to Linux in 2020, I have used Arch-based Linux distributions. I began using Ghostwriter on Manjaro after my experiences using markdown to compose \nour Buttondown-powered newsletters inspired me to begin working in markdown. I moved from Manjaro to Arch's closer cousin, EndeavourOS, in August 2022, where I remain today.\nGhostwriter has generally worked for me without issues. Early on, I had an issue with it sometimes not connecting to Pandoc, but that went away at some point. Since KDE took over development of Ghostwriter things were largely flawless. However, a few days ago, I noticed after updating either Pandoc or KDE (I did not catch which) that Ghostwriter was no longer recognizing Pandoc as a conversion option. This was a mild problem for me because I never took the time to learn the Pandoc CLI syntax (I really should get around to that). I could use MultiMarkdown to convert to .odt, but that vitiated many of my markdown formatting choices.\nHowever, before I had to deal with the issue for a work project, Pandoc returned as a conversion option after something was updated. Problem solved. It only proved to be a pain in the case of one somewhat long article wherein I had to re-do some of my formatting in Libre Office Writer.\nIf you enjoy strange Ghostwriter issues, take a trip back in time to learn about a segfault issue I had on a fresh Manjaro install in 2021.",

The first is that I try to write evergreen articles. The second is that I try to produce unique articles worth your time. There is no shortage of writing online. Some of the writing even comes from the keyboards of human beings writing in a language they are fluent in. While I try to bring a fresh perspective to all of my articles, I cannot always say that my topics are unique.

After going 8th overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, he had a short, uneventful, five-year career with four different teams. While college success by no means guarantees professional success, some of Respert's troubles were linked to the fact he was diagnosed with stomach cancer during his first season (he went into remission in his second season).  What prompted my article was the story of his response. Respert opted to keep his diagnosis secret, not only from the public, but also from his family -- even when he was being criticized in local media for his poor play.  He resolved to only tell his story after his playing career was over in order to ensure that no one could say, succeed or fail, that he made any excuses (to be sure, he had a decent one).\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/playing-through-cancer-in-silence-shawn-resperts-nba-story/\n#nba #basketball #sports #cancer",

          "description": "In a 2019 interview, a representative of the Czech-based Seznam search engine (interesting Czech-based project with its own crawler) discussed the challenges of indexing English-language sites due to the fact that many block all crawlers except Google.  Being a supporter of independent search indexes, I wrote a brief PSA for webmasters on the subject of allowing independent search engines with their own crawlers.  In addition to Seznam, I singled out @Mojeek , InfoTiger, and Marginalia Search as being worth whitelisting for sites with generally restrictive robots.txt rules.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/whitelisting-independent-search-crawlers/\n#searchengine #search #indexing #bots #webmaster",

          "description": "For example, the older model had a 1 GHz dual-core processor, while the new version has a 1.8 GHz quad-core chip. Since the company is tight-lipped about exactly which processors are powering these devices, it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but it sure sounds like the new model should be a bit more responsive.Both models have just 1GB of RAM, but the original InkPad Color had just 16GB of built-in storage, while the new model has twice as much. That said, it seems like the company might have omitted one feature when building the new model: there’s no longer a microSD card reader.\nI have the original PocketBook InkPad color and I generally like it. Most of the improvements in V2 would be welcome (albeit well short of prompting me to upgrade), but dropping the microSD card slot is a bad move.  The article suggests that this may have been done to increase the tablet's water resistance, but I will take the SD card over being able to submerge my e-reader in 2 meters of water.",
