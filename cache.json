I quote from my Leaflet:\nMy clear early-frontrunner for anime of the year in 2022 is the excellent third and final season of Teasing Master Takagi-san.

In Crimsoness, the player takes the role of Bakumi Moriyama, a schoolgirl who upon realizing that all of her answers on an exam were off by one, sets out to destroy the entire planet in 3 minutes.  The 3 minutes is literal here -- the novel is timed.  Crimsoness is, dare I say, literally an Earth-splitting adventure.\n(It was also looks like it was drawn in Microsoft Paint.)\nCrimsoness is free to download for Windows (the Japanese original also remains available to download). Unlike most novels I am reviewing, it was not written in ONScripter (Delphi, in this case), but the Windows version runs perfectly fine on top of WINE on Linux with no special configuration.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/crimsoness-visual-novel-review/\n#visualnovel #videogames #red",
