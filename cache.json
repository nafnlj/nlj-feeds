The trade, which saw the then-Vancouver Grizzlies trade a future, lightly protected first round pick, for a 35-year old Otis Thorpe nearing the end of his career (note the Grizzlies were coming off a 14-68 season) was so bad that one need not even qualify a critique of the trade with \"hindsight is 20/20.\" Had anyone stopped and thought for a moment, all of the sights would have advised not making that trade.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/1997-otis-thorpe-trade-and-the-2003-nba-draft/\n#nba #basketball #management #stats",

As we know, the Pistons drafted Darko Milicic, who played little in 2.5 seasons with the team, but they won the 2003-04 championship. After considering all the factors, I concluded in a long, stat-filled article, that with perfect hindsight, the Pistons should not have drafted Anthony, but I do offer some alternatives.\n(PS: I was proud of myself when I guessed the championship odds ranking going into 2002-03 and found that the betting odds rank on Basketball Reference matched my guess perfectly.)\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/should-the-pistons-have-drafted-carmelo/\n#nba #basketball #sports #stats",

          "description": "I reviewed a 2006 translation of a 2004 Japanese freeware visual novel called Collage last week. This one earns my clear recommendation. It is a story covering a couple of weeks in modern Japan told  from the perspective of three adults (probably in the age 28-30 range). Over the course of the story, we see how the lives of the characters are more connected than they seem. The translation reads very well and the story is clever. I also appreciated the game's visual flair and soundtrack, both of which reminded me a bit of Persona 3.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/collage-visual-novel-review/\n#visualnovel #visualnovels #game #freeware #doujin #japan",

Having finished the series, it left me a bit nonplussed.  The main character is Mitsumi Iwakura, an earnest girl from the countryside who attends high school in Tokyo to follow her dreams of becoming a politician who can revive her hometown.  Her friends play leading roles, but the co-main character is Sōsuke Shima, an attractive young man and former child actor who takes a liking to Mitsumi.  The entire series is pleasant enough, handled with care (see animation analysis) and I never considered not seeing it through to the end.  But while I have high tolerance for slow-paced shows and proverbial \"slice of life* pieces, but Skip to Loafer took my tolerance a bit too far.  Mitsumi is charming, but not particularly interesting.  Souske sees some solid development in the end, but we never get to know him quite well enough to make his past engaging.  I could see a second season improving on the first with the initial character intros done, but the first, standing alone, was decent albeit forgettable.\n(The opening song and animation is very good, however.)\n#SkipToLoafer #anime",

I thought that episode 12, which aired on Sunday, was the final episode. It featured the most relationship development for the 5th grade main character duo and would have been a fine place to leave off. I was surprised at the end of the episode to see that there will be a 13th and final episode with 10 years later in the title.  While my assumption is that it will be a dream episode (my understanding is that the manga is ongoing), ending with a legitimate 10-year after look would be an interesting way to conclude an anime about a 5th grade boy extending a hand to a lonely girl and becoming aware of special feelings (the clueless concept is hardly extendable as they grow older).  I'm curious to see what the finale is.  A good finale would make My Clueless First Friend a viable year-end top six candidate.\n#anime #MyCluelessFirstFriend",

          "description": "Several of the spring 2023 anime season series have picked up in their second halves since I expressed by concerns at the half-way point that the first half of 2023 was looking bleak. One of the most interesting (and arguably the best) series of the season is Oshi no Ko, which has achieved great popularity. The series focuses on the entertainment industry in Japan, often in a gritty way. It has impressive production values, but the overall product is inconsistent. One thing it has not failed at is hitting the big moments though. The ends of episodes 1, 7, and 9 are three of the most striking moments of anime in 2023 thus far. 9 was particularly impressive. It was not a surprise when we learned that Kana Arima is a legitimately good singer, but the set-up of her music video and the reactions of her group mates was well-done enough to earn some applause. Of course, unlike my previous three anime series of the year, Oregairu S3, SSSS.Dynazenon, and Teasting Master Takagi-san S3, Oshi no Ko has not put together an entire episode up to the standard of its best scenes. But it is making me think about how much a single scene can carry an episode or how a series of stand-out scenes can define a series. This idea needs more work. It will turn into an article at some point.\n#OshiNoKo #anime #anime2023",

The repo notes that there are plugins for keeping it up-to-date, but I thought of a better idea. After some clicking around, I found the atom feed for updates to the blocklist text file. I added it to mfeed, a Firefox extension I use to keep track of feeds for repo and software updates.

The protagonist, Kyo, came to an important realization. In addition to the story progress, this episode featured some beautiful backgrounds for Kyo's abbreviated vacation. I am curious to see if it resolves key points in its conclusion in the same way that Angel Next Door did last season. Despite the strong finish, the series is held back by a rough start and our lack of insight into Anna's perspective and feelings.\nMy Love Story With Yamada-kun 11\nIt has improved a bit in its second half (having noted that I was not impressed with the first half, and episode 11 offers some hope that something will be resolved in the finale (I have my doubts).  Akane, like Kyo, appears to have come to a realization (albeit she will state it clearly in the next episode).\nMix S2 10\nGranting that I am watching Mix without the benefit of having seen Touch, it continues to meander at a slow pace with surprisingly little baseball action, even compared to season 1. Generally pleasant, but stronger signs in episode 10 that it is going in an unfortunate direction on one of its romantic stories than we had before (not that the signs haven't been there, that is). I did appreciate one scene where the main protagonist, Touma, offered some meta-commentary on people losing interest in slow stories.  The ending song and animation is still fantastic, especially for a show that has a 1980s animation aesthetic.\n#anime #dangersinmyheart #yamadakunat999 #mix-anime",

          "description": "https://thenewleafjournal.com/\nI started NLJ back in 2020. It is built with WordPress (hosted on Hetzner VPS and managed with Cloudron). I have published more than 800 articles and 350 short-form posts (almost all posts by me, but my friend has published 30something articles). I write about whatever interests me (I tell myself this means there is something for everyone). Common topics include, but are not limited to, tech (digital ownership, open source software, feeds, and my learning Linux), history (usually American or Roman), old books and poems, anime, visual novels (mainly English translations of freeware NScripter/KiriKiri novels), photos from my walks, fictional dialogues, and occasional commentary about life in NYC.\nhttps://memos.emucafe.org/u/2\nI am testing out Memos (https://github.com/usememos/memos) for short-form notes and microblog-style posts, but very much a side project next to NLJ. Neat little tool.",
