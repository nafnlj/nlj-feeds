I have generally assumed it has to do with using DisplayPort for my primary monitor and HDMI for my secondary... but never quite figured it out. It is not a big deal since I turn my computer off when I am not using it anyway. Instead of continuing to dig into the weeds... I decided to install Xscreensaver and enable almost all of the screensavers.  Left my computer for about 20 minutes and returned to Pacman on my primary monitor and a dancing wireframe box on my secondary monitor.

          "description": "What does it mean from an American perspective to have been \"born overseas\"? I thought about this when I saw ESPN describe NBA Hall of Famer Tim Duncan as having been born overseas. Duncan was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands. While this is indeed over a sea, the U.S. Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States.  All persons born there are citizens from birth by operation of statute, and it is within the judicial jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. After reflecting on the issue, I concluded, for reasons stated in my article, that Duncan should not be described (from a U.S. perspective) as having been born \"overseas.\"\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/espn-states-tim-duncan-was-born-overseas/\n#definitions #nba #basketball #law #overseas",

          "description": "Before watching episode 2, I review the animation in episode 1 of The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses, one of the new anime series of the summer season. I was inspired to write the piece when I saw some dramatically different takes on the animation, ranging from crediting the first 3 minutes for having more frames than entire episodes of other shows to describing those same 3 minutes as being a crime against humanity.  On the whole, I offer some qualified praise for the style and attention to detail while also highlighting technical issues (inconsistent 3D assets, bad shadows, glitches) that are a bit concerning going forward.\nhttps://thenewleafjournal.com/the-girl-i-like-forgot-her-glasses-ep1-animation/\n#anime #animation #gohands #animereview",
