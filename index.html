                              <span>I previously noted that I could not start my local Radicale-DecSync server and that switching from the AUR package to the PyPi package resolved the issue.

However, I ran into the following error today when I tried to launch the local server:
[2023-06-11 15:56:14 -0400] [2661] [CRITICAL] An exception occurred during server startup: Failed to load storage module &#x27;radicale_storage_decsync&#x27;: libcrypt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


Solution from AUR libdecsync package:  Install libxcrypt-compat

                              <span>I started manually maintaining a list of stopwords for WordPress comments after opening our Guestbook. I figured that I could handle it manually instead of using a plugin. The approach was showing some results after two days, but it occurred to me that I could find a bigger stopword list.
https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist
I found this big one on GitHub and copied it into my install. The repo notes that there are plugins for keeping it up-to-date, but I thought of a better idea. After some clicking around, I found the atom feed for updates to the blocklist text file. I added it to mfeed, a Firefox extension I use to keep track of feeds for repo and software updates.  Now I will not only be able to keep my stopwords list up to date, but I also have a NLJ topic on keeping the list up to date without a plugin.

                              <span>Thoughts on anime episodes I watched yesterday:
The Dangers in My Heart 11
Posted its best episode for the second week in a row. The protagonist, Kyo, came to an important realization. In addition to the story progress, this episode featured some beautiful backgrounds for Kyo&#x27;s abbreviated vacation. I am curious to see if it resolves key points in its conclusion in the same way that Angel Next Door did last season. Despite the strong finish, the series is held back by a rough start and our lack of insight into Anna&#x27;s perspective and feelings.
My Love Story With Yamada-kun 11
It has improved a bit in its second half (having noted that I was not impressed with the first half, and episode 11 offers some hope that something will be resolved in the finale (I have my doubts).  Akane, like Kyo, appears to have come to a realization (albeit she will state it clearly in the next episode).
Mix S2 10
Granting that I am watching Mix without the benefit of having seen Touch, it continues to meander at a slow pace with surprisingly little baseball action, even compared to season 1. Generally pleasant, but stronger signs in episode 10 that it is going in an unfortunate direction on one of its romantic stories than we had before (not that the signs haven&#x27;t been there, that is). I did appreciate one scene where the main protagonist, Touma, offered some meta-commentary on people losing interest in slow stories.  The ending song and animation is still fantastic, especially for a show that has a 1980s animation aesthetic.

                              <span>This is N.A. Ferrell of The New Leaf Journal. I was interested in testing Memos as a note-taking microblog. I thought about using a subdomain of The New Leaf Journal, but I decided to start fresh under a different, very official-sounding banner.

                              <span>Welcome to the 139th edition of The Newsletter Leaf Journal, the official newsletter of the perennially virid online writing magazine, The New Leaf Journal. This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. While I did not publish many articles in the last week, one of the articles that I did publish is quite long. Moreover, this week saw the return of The New Leaf Journal Guestbook, albeit in a new form. Without further ado, let us cover the latest news, notes, and articles from around the web.

                              <span>But in full disclosure, Twitter did once come through in a big way for me. I am writing a long series of articles (now up to 21 reviews!) on old freeware Japanese visual novels that were translated for the 2005, 2006, and 2008 al|together festivals. A reader saw the series and sent a DM about trying to track down the novels. I did not see the DM for about 10 months. However, when I did, I worked with the sender (who is collecting them in a public MEGA Drive) on a couple of games and the interactions led me to track down the Japanese version of Manatsu no Kagerou, which is required for playingg the al|together translation since the English version is a patch. I found it in ONE older torrent... all of the original download links were dead.
(Review forthcoming next month.)

                              <span>I was reliably informed yesterday that it had been three years since I made a Twitter account for The New Leaf Journal. In those three years, our account has picked up 43 followers (or 40 if we leave out one of my friends and my NLJ colleague) and my most shared post was in 2020. All of the successes I had on Twitter were from a few of my articles making Hacker News page one, all of which spread on Twitter without my doing anything. As such, I would have done about as well on Twitter had I never made an account. Let no one say, however, that I did not predict this outcome back in 2020.

                              <span>Bing has blocked The New Leaf Journal from appearing in web search results since January (we were de-indexed in March). I created a GitHub repository to collect stories and resources about similar cases to help others with strange Bing problems.
(Note: For Microsoft reasons, I think this is one case were GitHub is the perfect host for this project.)

HT to @Dariusz_w for giving me the idea to share the story by publishing his excellent &quot;Bing Jail&quot; article and sharing it to Hacker News.

                              <span>I think I quipped on the NLJ a while back that I would like to see a remaster of Persona 3. I didn&#x27;t think there would be one. The trailer looks slick, but no evidence of change other than much better graphics. I think P3 has the best underlying story and aesthetic of the modern Personas, but FES is weaker than 4 Golden and 5 overall (4 Golden is my favorite on account of writing and characters).  I&#x27;ll reflect on this and think about what I&#x27;d like to see in a full 3 remake.

                              <span>I wrote a review of an open source Android launcher called Keikai Launcher a few days ago. On its own, Keikai is a simple bare-bones launcher. I would not use it as a primary launcher (I use TinyBit and Kiss would be my second choice), but it functions nicely for a second proposed use case -- an alternative app drawer.  When I need to survey my apps on my LineageOS phone, Keikai is a much more elegant solution than navigating to settings. Moreover, I could see it being very useful on locked down Android-derived devices which do not let the user change his or her default launcher, such as the Kindle Fire line. Keikai is available on GitHub and F-Droid.

                              <span>I decided to go with Shotwell for the time being instead of installing Nomacs as a Flatpak. Seems to do what I need (although I prefer Nomacs). I could not figure out how to change the size of the images though. Looked it up. You can only change size when saving? Weird. It works in the end...

                              <span>Interesting discussion on Manjaro going on. I used Manjaro (first KDE, then XFCE) for my first two years on Linux before switching to EndeavourOS. I chimed in to concur with a few commenters who much prefer EndeavourOS, but that comes with a caveat. While I am much happier on EndeavourOS, Manjaro&#x27;s GUI tools, notably Pamac, helped me get up to speed three years ago having come from only using Windows. EndeavourOS would have been a much heavier lift when I started.
(Note: Let us set aside that I should have been using something like Mint or one of the Ubuntus or derivatives thereof and not Manjaro.)

                              <span>I can see the strange Brooklyn NY haze from my window as I enjoy my coffee. The scene makes me sentimental (or sedimental) for one of my favorite video games -- a game which combined a foreboding fog with at least one touching family scene involving coffee.  I once wrote about this special scene and giving coffee to children on school nights.

I also sent a letter to their legal dept, but I think emailing their support did the trick. This is not a published email I dug it up in a forum post. Worked. Hope you get help too.
A Microsoft forum poster suggests an alternative email address, bwtsupport at microsoft dot com, for raising concerns about Bing de-indexing. This email is listed in some older posts from the official Bing blog.  I have not personally tested it yet but will keep a note here.</span>

                              <span>My review if Crimsoness, the official 2008 translation of a 2006 Japanese visual novel called Shakunetsu Hime. In Crimsoness, the player takes the role of Bakumi Moriyama, a schoolgirl who upon realizing that all of her answers on an exam were off by one, sets out to destroy the entire planet in 3 minutes.  The 3 minutes is literal here -- the novel is timed.  Crimsoness is, dare I say, literally an Earth-splitting adventure.
(It was also looks like it was drawn in Microsoft Paint.)
Crimsoness is free to download for Windows (the Japanese original also remains available to download). Unlike most novels I am reviewing, it was not written in ONScripter (Delphi, in this case), but the Windows version runs perfectly fine on top of WINE on Linux with no special configuration.

                              <span>I read about an e-ink monitor for phones and thought the idea was interesting (as someone who wants an open source e-ink phone with a physical keyboard), but impractical. Instead of spending $300 to test a monitor (not that this was in the cards), I tried using the open source Screen Stream app on F-Droid to stream my phone screen with my feed reader to my PocketBook InkPad Color. Conclusion:  It *works* -- but there are some practical annoyances.

                              <span>I read a Nintendo Life survey of the best Nintendo controllers. I noted while reading that I had owned and used every controller except one. Somewhat improbably, the &quot;one&quot; is the Wii U Pro Controller, but not the Virtual Boy or NES (101) controllers. Go figure. Having determined that I have the relevant experience to weigh in, I offered my own Nintendo controller takes, but separated into categories... best non-joystick controller (SNES); best joystick controller (GCN/Switch Pro), and best joystick (N64).

                              <span>My article on the origin of Mother&#x27;s Day, originally envisioned by Anna Jarvis in 1907-08 as a non-commercial occasion. I linked to original newspaper reports of the first Mother&#x27;s Day commemorations in the United States and in Australia.
