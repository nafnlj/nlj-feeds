        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use KDE"s Ghostwriter for all of my markdown writing needs. It has a Pandoc GUI. I have reason for a work project to want to go from markdown to pdf but without page numbers on the resulting pdf output. I hunted for a solution and found a good YAML-based trick.
https://memos.emucafe.org/m/27
Do any pandoc experts have a better idea? This one does work without any additional Pandoc fiddling in Ghostwriter.

This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell.
This will be an unusual newsletter since I did not actually publish any articles this week. I was busy with work and plagued by sinus issues. I do have an article in the pipeline, but I have not gotten around to publishing it yet. (Next week will likely be on the quiet side as well, albeit busy compared to a week of no publishing.) But we need not let the lack of publishing at The New Leaf Journal hinder its newsletter cousin...

I have generally assumed it has to do with using DisplayPort for my primary monitor and HDMI for my secondary... but never quite figured it out. It is not a big deal since I turn my computer off when I am not using it anyway. Instead of continuing to dig into the weeds... I decided to install Xscreensaver and enable almost all of the screensavers.  Left my computer for about 20 minutes and returned to Pacman on my primary monitor and a dancing wireframe box on my secondary monitor.  Highly recommended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What does it mean from an American perspective to have been "born overseas"? I thought about this when I saw ESPN describe NBA Hall of Famer Tim Duncan as having been born overseas. Duncan was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands. While this is indeed over a sea, the U.S. Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States.  All persons born there are citizens from birth by operation of statute, and it is within the judicial jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. After reflecting on the issue, I concluded, for reasons stated in my article, that Duncan should not be described (from a U.S. perspective) as having been born "overseas."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before watching episode 2, I review the animation in episode 1 of The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses, one of the new anime series of the summer season. I was inspired to write the piece when I saw some dramatically different takes on the animation, ranging from crediting the first 3 minutes for having more frames than entire episodes of other shows to describing those same 3 minutes as being a crime against humanity.  On the whole, I offer some qualified praise for the style and attention to detail while also highlighting technical issues (inconsistent 3D assets, bad shadows, glitches) that are a bit concerning going forward.

I was going to send a guide after I remembered myself -- then I figured I ought to just publish the guide on the NLJ.  Note that I personally use Lutris (and occasionally Bottles) as a WINE GUI, but PlayOnLinux still works fairly well and is certainly the better choice for a 2007 MacBook with 1 GB of RAM running Bodhi Linux.

Note that the ranking comes with the caveat that statistics come from Koko Analytics, which is an entirely local WordPress page counter with no third party scripts or connections. It respects Do Not Track and does not work for users who block JS, so it is (by design) not as robust as commercial solutions.  However, I have found that its recording of Google referrers is usually fairly close to what I see in Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster), so I'll count it as close enough for all normal, non-creepy purposes.

I don't think anyone really read it (such is the fate of small photo posts). However, according to my local privacy-friendly analytics tool, Koko Analytics, I suddenly got a large number of referrals from Facebook (unusual, if not unprecedented) all pointing to the banana bench article. I guess someone shared it. However, I don't have Facebook, so the source will forever be a mystery. You too can enjoy the banana bench.

While I don't think I need a task management app per se, I decided to see how Zim works. I set up a new Planner notebook with the tasks and journal plugins enabled. I am getting the hang of it, but it has a neat, simple syntax out of the box. Thinking about some ways to turn it into a full-fledged planner.

https://shumplations.com/feed (translations of Japanese game developer interviews)
https://www.loc.gov/collections/global-legal-monitor/?fo=rss (summaries of legal news from around the world)

https://blog.sakugabooru.com/feed (detailed essays on the anime industry and production)
htpps://perishablepress.com/feed/atom (personal website of WordPress developer Jeff Starr)
https://ai.mee.nu/feed/atom (daily tech news with strong opinions)
https://www.washingtontimes.com/rss/authors/stephen-dinan (one of the best reporters on immigration law/border issues)
https://liliputing.com/feed (news about mini PCs and mobile devices)
https://worldofmatthew.com/index.xml (essays on digital ownership and random musings)
I would also humbly recommend my own writing project, link in my profile if you're interested
I also recommend looking at Morss.it (https://morss.it/) if there is a site you want to subscribe to without a feed. It generally works very well (RSS Bridge and RSS Hub serve the same purpose if you want to self-host).]]></summary>

It is a static site feed aggregator primarily designed to go with GitHub Pages. I host one to aggregate my own writing on different sites. I think it may fit your use case because your Osmosfeed site itself outputs a single Atom feed. So, for example, if I have an Osmosfeed site that aggregates feeds 1, 2, and 3, the Osmosfeed site has a single feed which will include the three individual feeds. Mine has about 10-12 feeds and it has worked perfectly thus far with no issues. Not sure if it would have problems at higher numbers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a companion article, I told the story of the 1997 trade which netted the Pistons the #2 pick off a 50-win season in 2003. The trade, which saw the then-Vancouver Grizzlies trade a future, lightly protected first round pick, for a 35-year old Otis Thorpe nearing the end of his career (note the Grizzlies were coming off a 14-68 season) was so bad that one need not even qualify a critique of the trade with "hindsight is 20/20." Had anyone stopped and thought for a moment, all of the sights would have advised not making that trade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 2003 NBA Draft by addressing a hypothetical -- should the Detroit Pistons, who lucked into the second overall pick despite coming off a 50 win season thanks to a trade from 1997, have drafted Carmelo Anthony? As we know, the Pistons drafted Darko Milicic, who played little in 2.5 seasons with the team, but they won the 2003-04 championship. After considering all the factors, I concluded in a long, stat-filled article, that with perfect hindsight, the Pistons should not have drafted Anthony, but I do offer some alternatives.
(PS: I was proud of myself when I guessed the championship odds ranking going into 2002-03 and found that the betting odds rank on Basketball Reference matched my guess perfectly.)

For those who had a 4th of July event deferred, I present my 2021 (fictional) dialogue on the PURPOSE of July 4 grilling. As one of the three major characters in the dialogue argues -- the purpose is very clearly ritualistic sacrifices to the Founding Fathers ("argues" is the operative word).

I write about whatever interests me (I tell myself this means there is something for everyone). Common topics include, but are not limited to, tech (digital ownership, open source software, feeds, and my learning Linux), history (usually American or Roman), old books and poems, anime, visual novels (mainly English translations of freeware NScripter/KiriKiri novels), photos from my walks, fictional dialogues, and occasional commentary about life in NYC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 4, 1923, a Reverend Charles W. Lyons delivered an Independence Day oration titled "The American Mind" (the title was inspired by a Jefferson quote). In a 2021 article, I re-printed the entire oration and offered my own commentary. Having put my thoughts in the article, I submit a fun fact for Mastodon. Lyons, who was a Jesuit priest, is the only man to have served as president of four different American colleges (Gonzaga, St. Joseph's, Boston College, and Georgetown).
