        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While installing EndeavourOS on a mini PC yesterday, I ran into an error at 13% complete which forced install to fail. The issue was likely tied to a failure to download updates (computer did not have onboard wi-fi, so I was using a cheap Panda Wireless dongle which only supports 2.4 connections). When I tried to go through the installer again, automatic disk partitioning was not available. Solution: Rebooted and went back into live environment and installed offline (no issue since I wanted KDE Plasma). Installed with no issue.

When I walked by last week, I decided to take a photo and turn it into an article. Despite the fact that the name invokes our 41st, 42nd, and 43rd Presidents, those with a cursory knowledge of New York City history will know that the "Clinton" here is DeWitt Clinton, who served as Mayor of NYC, Governor of NY (following his father George on Governor) and was the Federalist nominee for President in 1812 (he lost fairly narrowly to James Madison). What about Bush? I was not sure who Bush Street was named after, and I learned that New York City is also not quite sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read about an adware company purchasing the open source Simple Mobile Tools apps for Android. I was not using any of the apps at the moment (I used a few in the past), so I decided to offer some suggestions for alternatives that I use on my own device (I run LineageOS 20 on my phone). My recommendations are admittedly limited by my set up and phone usage, but I think I have a few good ones.

However, “free and open source” will likely be a thing of the past after Simple Mobile Tools was acquired by ZippoApps. I used a few Simple Mobile apps back when I wrote a review of F-Droid apps in 2021, but I was fortunately not using any at the time of the ZippoApps news. One of the main contributors to Simple Mobile Tools who was not involved in the decision to sell the suite to an adware company forked the project. The fork looks like a good option for people who want to keep using the Simple Mobile Tools suite. Since I was not using any of the apps, I thought I would note what I use instead.

While I am not big on social media, I use Mastodon, Pixelfed, Minds, and NOSTR to help promote my writing on my self-hosted WordPress projects. I have had an interest in open source alternatives to Goodreads. There are a few interesting ActivityPub powered projects, but they are not quite what I am looking for. At the moment, I am trying Open Library. You can see my fresh profile and current reading.
I like it thus far. Once you know where everything is, it is easy to navigate and organize books. I also like LibraryThing (not open source), but that is more geared toward collection management than reading tracking. My top request for Open Library is RSS/ATOM support. I maintain a static site with all of my feeds (including this site) and would like to be able to drop an Open Library feed in there without having to be creative. Libreture (for storing and managing DRM-free ebooks) and Inventaire (for cataloguing and trading physical ebooks) both produce feeds for user profiles. Alas, that seems to still be a missing feature for Open Library and LibraryThing. I could see others being disappointed with Open Library's relative lack of social functionality, but I think that may be more of a feature than a bug.]]></summary>

Very interesting take that you demonstrate through the performance. Question: Can you think of any examples of folk songs that jump out to you where the songwriter intended for the song to change depending on how the vocalist interprets it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I published my previous Bearblog post (it has been a while) back in the middle of the spring anime season (see post). The year is coming to an end. Despite my having written in that post that there was no clear anime of the year front-runner as of the middle of the spring season, my current front-runner for anime of the year (expect my New Leaf Journal year in review at the end of December or early January) is from that very spring season (see my 2022 review).
But I digress.
Since last posting here, I acquired the emucafe.org domain to use for my new social publishing site. Because I paid the small fee for extra Bearblog features, I figured that I may as well use it here too. Thus, my new main domain here is newleafannex.emucafe.org. For anyone considering using their own domain with Bearblog, I will say that the set-up process works exactly as advertised in the docs.]]></summary>

This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell.
Today's newsletter falls on New York City's Evacuation Day. What is Evacuation Day? You can learn about it in a link in our Leaves from the week that was section below. While I usually limit this humble newsletter to articles published from the previous Saturday to the Friday preceding the newsletter, I made an exception for New York City's patriotic holiday. Other than this exception, you will find your favorite (I hope) regularly scheduled newsletter sections below.

It commemorated the evacuation, or final departure, of the British military from Manhattan on November 25, 1783, which was followed by the entry of the U.S. military led by a certain General George Washington.
