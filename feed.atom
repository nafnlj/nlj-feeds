Because everyone likes rankings, I concluded with a ranking of the slogans based on the slogans in and of themselves and how they fit the city or town.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the 157th edition of The Newsletter Leaf Journal, the official newsletter of the perennially virid online writing magazine, The New Leaf Journal. This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. This week was a bit short on content with just three new articles -- although all three were fairly time-intensive by my standards. You will find links to our three new pieces along with links from around the web and other news and notes below.
(No News leaf journal section this week because I have no news to report other than our new articles.)
