        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I continue to make progress on my new social publishing site, The Emu Café Social. I have two outstanding issues:
Status post error when Friends plugin is enabled and Post Kinds is disabled. This is not an immediate issue since I am using both, but any situation wherein one plugin depends on another when the plugins provide different features makes me uncomfortable.
Micropub plugin does not create an endpoint. This is minor since I do not personally plan to publish much using the Micropub endpoint, but it bothers me. I will need to investigate since I am unsure of the issue. I confirmed IndieAuth, on which Micropub depends, does work.
No other major issues at the moment. My ActivityPub profiles briefly stopped working, but I think I fixed that by ensuring that WP Super Cache does not cache author pages.
