        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Mario Party for Nintendo 64 had some poorly-conceived mini games that required players to rapidly spin the delicate Nintendo 64 joystick. I remember them for destroying joysticks. Others claimed terrible injuries. This is the story of Nintendo's offer of gloves as a result of a settlement with New York State (I note the gloves would not have saved any controllers from harm).

Because I had no articles to share and I still had work to do last weekend, I let October 28 pass without a newsletter. While I have a few article drafts in the pipeline, I still have not published a new piece since October …]]></summary>
