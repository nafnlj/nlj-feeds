        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1954 years to the day (April 16, 69 AD), the Roman Emperor Otho ended his brief reign by his own hand rather than continue in a Civil War for the throne against Vilettlius. Otho's seemingly noble(-ish) end captured the imagination of Roman historians in light of the fact he had previously been noted for his relationship to Nero, having serious debt problems, and seizing the throne by murdering his predecessor in January 69.  I wrote a very long article about the enigmatic life and death of Otho, focusing on comparing four Roman historian accounts and their different opinions on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shawn Respert was one of the best college basketball players of the early 90s, winning NCAA player of the year in 1995. After going 8th overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, he had a short, uneventful, five-year career with four different teams. While college success by no means guarantees professional success, some of Respert's troubles were linked to the fact he was diagnosed with stomach cancer during his first season (he went into remission in his second season).  What prompted my article was the story of his response. Respert opted to keep his diagnosis secret, not only from the public, but also from his family -- even when he was being criticized in local media for his poor play.  He resolved to only tell his story after his playing career was over in order to ensure that no one could say, succeed or fail, that he made any excuses (to be sure, he had a decent one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the Ghostwriter markdown editor (see my Ghostwriter review) to draft articles for The New Leaf Journal and briefs and memoranda for my day job as a legal research specialist. In both cases, I have to convert my documents from markdown. I convert New Leaf Journal articles to .odt for editing while I convert my legal work to to .docx. (See my article on my New Leaf Journal workflow.)
Since switching to Linux in 2020, I have used Arch-based Linux distributions. I began using Ghostwriter on Manjaro after my experiences using markdown to compose 
our Buttondown-powered newsletters inspired me to begin working in markdown. I moved from Manjaro to Arch's closer cousin, EndeavourOS, in August 2022, where I remain today.
Ghostwriter has generally worked for me without issues. Early on, I had an issue with it sometimes not connecting to Pandoc, but that went away at some point. Since KDE took over development of Ghostwriter things were largely flawless. However, a few days ago, I noticed after updating either Pandoc or KDE (I did not catch which) that Ghostwriter was no longer recognizing Pandoc as a conversion option. This was a mild problem for me because I never took the time to learn the Pandoc CLI syntax (I really should get around to that). I could use MultiMarkdown to convert to .odt, but that vitiated many of my markdown formatting choices.
However, before I had to deal with the issue for a work project, Pandoc returned as a conversion option after something was updated. Problem solved. It only proved to be a pain in the case of one somewhat long article wherein I had to re-do some of my formatting in Libre Office Writer.
If you enjoy strange Ghostwriter issues, take a trip back in time to learn about a segfault issue I had on a fresh Manjaro install in 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a 2019 interview, a representative of the Czech-based Seznam search engine (interesting Czech-based project with its own crawler) discussed the challenges of indexing English-language sites due to the fact that many block all crawlers except Google.  Being a supporter of independent search indexes, I wrote a brief PSA for webmasters on the subject of allowing independent search engines with their own crawlers.  In addition to Seznam, I singled out @Mojeek , InfoTiger, and Marginalia Search as being worth whitelisting for sites with generally restrictive robots.txt rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tagline of my main project, The New Leaf Journal, is "where the leaves are perennially virid." As I explained in a post on the inspiration for the tagline, the slogan gets at two ideas. The first is that I try to write evergreen articles. The second is that I try to produce unique articles worth your time. There is no shortage of writing online. Some of the writing even comes from the keyboards of human beings writing in a language they are fluent in. While I try to bring a fresh perspective to all of my articles, I cannot always say that my topics are unique. However, I published a short "leaflet" aside yesterday which I think is unique.

In that post, I collected English-language sources on a certain legend that Natsume Sōseki had suggested "tsuki ga kirei" (the Moon is beautiful) as a Japanese translation for "I love you." I had learned about the tsuki ga kirei legend from the excellent 2017 anime series (it featured in my decade review, Tsuki ga Kirei, and while it is likely a work of fiction (I knew that going into my research project), the phrase is aesthetically elegant.

Unsurprisingly given my small number of posts and the fact that I tend to reserve my best content for The New Leaf Journal (I largely leave quality determinations to others), I only have a handful of Bear Blog readers. From this small sample, I have noted that a majority of my readers are based in Romania. Nearly all of the referrals are from Bear Blog (not surprising). Are there a large number of Bear Blog users and readers in Romania or are people using VPNs? The sample size is too small for me to make much of it. I personally use Mullvad VPN, but I set the location to New York instead of Romania.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My review of Shooting Star Hill, the official English version of the freeware 2005 Japanese visual novel, Hoshi no Furu Oka. It tells the story of a lonely (alien?) girl and the boy who wants to befriend her.  I enjoyed Shooting Star Hill and it is one of the better entries from the review project that I am doing. It takes about one hour to read and remains free to download and run. Linux users should either run the Windows version under WINE or replace the old Linux ONScripter-EN executable that comes with the game with the most recent build (links and instructions in article).
(Note: I should really replace those old screenshots with borderless screenshots... someday.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post, I offered my very early impressions of a free and open source Android feed reader and read-it-later app called Handy Reading. My early impressions were very favorable because, by combining feed reading and read-it-later into a local app, it perfectly suits my reading-flow (see my post on combining feeds with a read-it-later solution). However, I had one pressing issue with Handy Reading:
Handy Reading re-fetches old, previously seen articles from a small number of feeds, which is a bit annoying.
Two days later, I think that I have tentatively resolved the issue. By default, Handy Reading has a short "keep old articles" time. It seems that if a feed is offering old articles outside the scope of Handy Reading's kept article time, it will re-fetch those old articles and display them is new even if you have already marked them as read in the app. Fortunately, Handy Reading allows you to set the keep old articles period on a feed-by-feed basis. I have been doing that with the offending feeds and so far the results have been good.
Provided no new issues pop up, I will try a few additional features of Handy Reading before proceeding to a review. One issue that I am particularly interested in is testing its import/export functionality, since that proved to be an issue with my previous solution -- Flym DecSync. I recently talked to one Mastodon user who reported that Handy Reading does not handle Mastodon feeds, which is true. While I hope this is fixed, it is not a priority for me since I do not use my feed reader for social feeds.]]></summary>

Certain changes or updates seem to restore lazy loading, requiring me to manually flush the cache.  The issue is easy to resolve... fortunately much easier than back in June 2020  when Bluehost (we're no longer with Bluehost) had some terrible server side caching that cached a plugin-cached version of my homepage from a week earlier (that was fun because I had no idea what I was doing in June 2020, I have a 33.4% idea of what I am doing now).

I planned to write a full review of DecSync for RSS. However, by the time I finally sat down to write my DecSync review, I had already moved from using DecSync for feeds to Handy Reading, a free and open source feed reader and read-it-later app for Android. Handy Reading, a fork of the no-longer-maintained Flym feed reader, is available on F-Droid. The Flym link is notable for me since I had been using a different Flym fork, Flym DecSync, prior to switching.
I am very impressed with Handy Reading two weeks in. It does not have the prettiest UI (compares unfavorably to Feeder in this respect), but it is good e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My online writing website, The New Leaf Journal was de-indexed by Bing back in January. The initial de-indexing inspired me to look into ways to improve the site. While I think I accomplished that, nothing had to do with resolving the mysterious Bing issue, which remains unexplained on Bing's Webmaster Console and apparently inapplicable to every other search engine crawler.
One thing I have considered in improving the site is streamlining. That is, I am working to slim The New Leaf Journal down (it was fairly slim to begin with, however) and use WordPress's native functionality in lieu of plugins wherever possible ("possible" is limited by my lack of php knowledge and coding ability, however).

This newsletter comes to you as always from the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. We recently had our Saturday newsletters fall on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve just a few months ago. Today we land on April Fools. While I published a few articles about olden April Fools pranks in 2021 and 2022, I am not much of an April Fools person myself. Thus, you can enjoy your regular newsletter content without fearing a prank, but I will have some April Fools-related links for your weekend reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of why I chose Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten for a review was because my earlier post on the series, which dealt with my trying to figure out where I had heard its primary ending song before (answer: S1 of Teasing Master Takagi-san) did relatively well by our modest, Bing-blacklisted standards.  If that quaint article could do well, why not a full review?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I decided to take a stab at writing a couple of anime reviews each season. First up is my excessively long review of The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten, written for both people who haven't watched the series and those who have.  In addition to offering a general (largely spoiler-free) summary and my impressions, I also explain how I think the series should be understood.  Final verdict:  While not without some faults in writing (I  introduce my concept of "two-by-four story-telling) and production quality control, charming on the whole and better than its absurdly long light novel title would indicate.

https://thenewleafjournal.com/decsync-review/
I personally use DecSync for contacts, calendars, and tasks, and I used it for feeds for about one year. It works well and is an interesting project, but note that clients and implementations are primarily for Android and Linux (I use it with EndeavourOS and LineageOS).
