        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 4, 1923, a Reverend Charles W. Lyons delivered an Independence Day oration titled "The American Mind" (the title was inspired by a Jefferson quote). In a 2021 article, I re-printed the entire oration and offered my own commentary. Having put my thoughts in the article, I submit a fun fact for Mastodon. Lyons, who was a Jesuit priest, is the only man to have served as president of four different American colleges (Gonzaga, St. Joseph's, Boston College, and Georgetown).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final thoughts:  Skip to Loafer
I was not familiar with the underlying Skip to Loafer manga when I saw a preview for the anime series, but the concept looked interesting enough.  Having finished the series, it left me a bit nonplussed.  The main character is Mitsumi Iwakura, an earnest girl from the countryside who attends high school in Tokyo to follow her dreams of becoming a politician who can revive her hometown.  Her friends play leading roles, but the co-main character is Sōsuke Shima, an attractive young man and former child actor who takes a liking to Mitsumi.  The entire series is pleasant enough, handled with care (see animation analysis) and I never considered not seeing it through to the end.  But while I have high tolerance for slow-paced shows and proverbial "slice of life* pieces, but Skip to Loafer took my tolerance a bit too far.  Mitsumi is charming, but not particularly interesting.  Souske sees some solid development in the end, but we never get to know him quite well enough to make his past engaging.  I could see a second season improving on the first with the initial character intros done, but the first, standing alone, was decent albeit forgettable.
(The opening song and animation is very good, however.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Penultimate episode thoughts:  My Clueless First Friend
My Clueless First Friend is one of the better anime series of the season. I thought that episode 12, which aired on Sunday, was the final episode. It featured the most relationship development for the 5th grade main character duo and would have been a fine place to leave off. I was surprised at the end of the episode to see that there will be a 13th and final episode with 10 years later in the title.  While my assumption is that it will be a dream episode (my understanding is that the manga is ongoing), ending with a legitimate 10-year after look would be an interesting way to conclude an anime about a 5th grade boy extending a hand to a lonely girl and becoming aware of special feelings (the clueless concept is hardly extendable as they grow older).  I'm curious to see what the finale is.  A good finale would make My Clueless First Friend a viable year-end top six candidate.

Working with 2011: Night of the Forget-Me-Nots, Visions from the Other Side
Working with neither:  Wanderers in the Sky (glitchy sound at title, the nothing), The World to Reverse -- Hallucinate (no music on Linux with any version, does work with original Windows .exe and Fluidsynth on top of WINE)
Will test My Black Cat shortly since I recall that one also has a MIDI requirement and then file an issue report on GitHub. Off the top of my head, I think he other al|together games with MIDI issues were all KiriKiri.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several of the spring 2023 anime season series have picked up in their second halves since I expressed by concerns at the half-way point that the first half of 2023 was looking bleak. One of the most interesting (and arguably the best) series of the season is Oshi no Ko, which has achieved great popularity. The series focuses on the entertainment industry in Japan, often in a gritty way. It has impressive production values, but the overall product is inconsistent. One thing it has not failed at is hitting the big moments though. The ends of episodes 1, 7, and 9 are three of the most striking moments of anime in 2023 thus far. 9 was particularly impressive. It was not a surprise when we learned that Kana Arima is a legitimately good singer, but the set-up of her music video and the reactions of her group mates was well-done enough to earn some applause. Of course, unlike my previous three anime series of the year, Oregairu S3, SSSS.Dynazenon, and Teasting Master Takagi-san S3, Oshi no Ko has not put together an entire episode up to the standard of its best scenes. But it is making me think about how much a single scene can carry an episode or how a series of stand-out scenes can define a series. This idea needs more work. It will turn into an article at some point.

“one more step” page inviting the visitor to complete a reCAPTCHA to access the

a fallacious equivocation of IPs and users which has been found to be highly
detrimental to Tor users in terms of the browseability of the web.
This is a good critique of Cloudflare CAPTCHAs. They are especially annoying when using a VPN (I use Mullvad) or unusual browser configurations. I wrote about how the Wayback Machine provides a good end-around the CAPTCHA deluge for pages which have been captured.

My favorite game controller ever is the Dreamcast, so I decided to be creative and get a GuilKit KingKong 2 Pro with a Hall Effect joystick to rekindle the magic.

It requires a Japanese language environment. It also needs Japanese fonts or things won't display correctly (the default fonts I installed from the AUR did not work well here). I ran it on top of WINE without any problems after the initial configuration.  Unlike most of the al|together translations, there is no native Linux version (this one was written in KiriKiri instead of ONScripter-EN).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a 2006 translation of a 2004 Japanese freeware visual novel called Collage last week. This one earns my clear recommendation. It is a story covering a couple of weeks in modern Japan told  from the perspective of three adults (probably in the age 28-30 range). Over the course of the story, we see how the lives of the characters are more connected than they seem. The translation reads very well and the story is clever. I also appreciated the game's visual flair and soundtrack, both of which reminded me a bit of Persona 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current visual novel review project, The Letter, is the 2008 translation of a 2007 Japanese visual novel called Tegami. Like most of the al|together translation projects visual novels, Tegami was written in NScripter. However, the 2007 release was its second release. The first version was created with Yuuki! Novel. I looked up Yuuki! Novel and found a couple of interesting resources:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160208042342/http://freett.com/yuukiex/yuukinovel.html (Last capture of official website, download links still work)
https://visuallyneko.wordpress.com/visual-novel-tools/yuukinovel/ (short article about)
I downloaded the latest release of Yuuki! Novel (latest being from 2005) and an English-language translation of some of its docs. File away for a future project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading through The Letter for my next al|together review. I had an interesting issue that I will document here.
Downloaded Windows installer from Insani's al|together 2008
Extracted contents of Windows .exe into a new directory
(Note: Running EndeavourOS with mainline Linux kernel)
Ran Galladite's newest build of ONScripter-EN for Linux in the directory (https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-en/releases/tag/2023-06-05)
Initially had skipping and static noise in the music
Tested Kaisernet's 2011 build and had the same issue
Tested on secondary PC running Fedora and had no issue
Rebooted my workstation and then sound worked with no issue with Galladite's newest ONScripter-EN build
I don't know what the issue was -- but The Letter has a great soundtrack, so I am glad that I resolved it (somehow)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started manually maintaining a list of stopwords for WordPress comments after opening our Guestbook. I figured that I could handle it manually instead of using a plugin. The approach was showing some results after two days, but it occurred to me that I could find a bigger stopword list.
https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist
I found this big one on GitHub and copied it into my install. The repo notes that there are plugins for keeping it up-to-date, but I thought of a better idea. After some clicking around, I found the atom feed for updates to the blocklist text file. I added it to mfeed, a Firefox extension I use to keep track of feeds for repo and software updates.  Now I will not only be able to keep my stopwords list up to date, but I also have a NLJ topic on keeping the list up to date without a plugin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts on anime episodes I watched yesterday:
The Dangers in My Heart 11
Posted its best episode for the second week in a row. The protagonist, Kyo, came to an important realization. In addition to the story progress, this episode featured some beautiful backgrounds for Kyo's abbreviated vacation. I am curious to see if it resolves key points in its conclusion in the same way that Angel Next Door did last season. Despite the strong finish, the series is held back by a rough start and our lack of insight into Anna's perspective and feelings.
My Love Story With Yamada-kun 11
It has improved a bit in its second half (having noted that I was not impressed with the first half, and episode 11 offers some hope that something will be resolved in the finale (I have my doubts).  Akane, like Kyo, appears to have come to a realization (albeit she will state it clearly in the next episode).
Mix S2 10
Granting that I am watching Mix without the benefit of having seen Touch, it continues to meander at a slow pace with surprisingly little baseball action, even compared to season 1. Generally pleasant, but stronger signs in episode 10 that it is going in an unfortunate direction on one of its romantic stories than we had before (not that the signs haven't been there, that is). I did appreciate one scene where the main protagonist, Touma, offered some meta-commentary on people losing interest in slow stories.  The ending song and animation is still fantastic, especially for a show that has a 1980s animation aesthetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But in full disclosure, Twitter did once come through in a big way for me. I am writing a long series of articles (now up to 21 reviews!) on old freeware Japanese visual novels that were translated for the 2005, 2006, and 2008 al|together festivals. A reader saw the series and sent a DM about trying to track down the novels. I did not see the DM for about 10 months. However, when I did, I worked with the sender (who is collecting them in a public MEGA Drive) on a couple of games and the interactions led me to track down the Japanese version of Manatsu no Kagerou, which is required for playingg the al|together translation since the English version is a patch. I found it in ONE older torrent... all of the original download links were dead.
(Review forthcoming next month.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reliably informed yesterday that it had been three years since I made a Twitter account for The New Leaf Journal. In those three years, our account has picked up 43 followers (or 40 if we leave out one of my friends and my NLJ colleague) and my most shared post was in 2020. All of the successes I had on Twitter were from a few of my articles making Hacker News page one, all of which spread on Twitter without my doing anything. As such, I would have done about as well on Twitter had I never made an account. Let no one say, however, that I did not predict this outcome back in 2020.

(Note: For Microsoft reasons, I think this is one case were GitHub is the perfect host for this project.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think I quipped on the NLJ a while back that I would like to see a remaster of Persona 3. I didn't think there would be one. The trailer looks slick, but no evidence of change other than much better graphics. I think P3 has the best underlying story and aesthetic of the modern Personas, but FES is weaker than 4 Golden and 5 overall (4 Golden is my favorite on account of writing and characters).  I'll reflect on this and think about what I'd like to see in a full 3 remake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a review of an open source Android launcher called Keikai Launcher a few days ago. On its own, Keikai is a simple bare-bones launcher. I would not use it as a primary launcher (I use TinyBit and Kiss would be my second choice), but it functions nicely for a second proposed use case -- an alternative app drawer.  When I need to survey my apps on my LineageOS phone, Keikai is a much more elegant solution than navigating to settings. Moreover, I could see it being very useful on locked down Android-derived devices which do not let the user change his or her default launcher, such as the Kindle Fire line. Keikai is available on GitHub and F-Droid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interesting discussion on Manjaro going on. I used Manjaro (first KDE, then XFCE) for my first two years on Linux before switching to EndeavourOS. I chimed in to concur with a few commenters who much prefer EndeavourOS, but that comes with a caveat. While I am much happier on EndeavourOS, Manjaro's GUI tools, notably Pamac, helped me get up to speed three years ago having come from only using Windows. EndeavourOS would have been a much heavier lift when I started.
(Note: Let us set aside that I should have been using something like Mint or one of the Ubuntus or derivatives thereof and not Manjaro.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched from Manjaro to EndeavourOS last year after using Manjaro for two (Manjaro was my first experience with Linux as a daily driver) and agree with this fully. I much prefer using Arch's regular repositories to Manjaro's. But having used Manjaro as my first distribution (I shouldn't have been using an Arch-based distro, but that aside), I don't think EndeavourOS is a one-to-one normie replacement in all respects. While I don't need or want Manjaro's GUI tools now, Pamac and its GUI kernel/driver tools helped me make the adjustment from having only used Windows to Linux. I am sure I could have managed on EndeavourOS, but it would have been more difficult at the time.]]></summary>
