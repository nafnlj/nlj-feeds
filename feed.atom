While Duncan was not born in one of the 50 states, he was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands -- which is a U.S. territory.  In my essay, I make the case that Duncan should not be described as having been born "overseas" in the sense the term is most commonly understood.

I will review Tomozaki S2 at the end of the season. These are a few notes on the first five episodes for future reference.

Animation quality in episodes 1 and 5 was solid. Weaker in episodes 2-4 with some instances of off-model characters that we saw in the weaker points of S1.
