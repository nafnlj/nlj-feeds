This plugin adds a simple post-type drop-down to the post editor interface, allowing you to reassign any post to a new post type. It allows you to switch post’s type while editing your post.
It supports custom post types. This may come in handy down the line, so I am saving it here as a proverbial bookmark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The boy-Emperor Romulus Augustulus is often described as the last (Western) Roman Emperor. He abdicated the royal purple to Odoacer on September 4, 476. But there remained another claimant to the title of Western Roman Emperor -- the exiled Julius Nepos, who lived until 480. Who was the last Western Roman Emperor? One year to the day, I wrote an article on this ultimately unimportant question.

I want to master Golf 1990, but one initial challenge is that estimated distances are not included with clubs (Mario Golf for GBC had... some QoL improvements). Like anyone who played games in the early 2000s, I knew where to find the answer: Game FAQs:

I have a 2018 model TCL TV that I do not give access to the internet (this one works without any issue, but I don't know if that is true of newer models). My TV is right next to my desktop computer, but in order to reduce noise and power, I bought a cheap Beelink mini PC and set it up with Fedora-GNOME and Kodi. Works very well for simple purposes and can easily handle light games. There are plenty of other (possibly better) solutions to this effect such as SBCs, spare laptops, or more capable mini PCs to handle some newer games. I would prefer using a computer instead of the Smart TV OS even without all of the concerns listed in the original post.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a minor screen tearing issue on an old netbook (I do not know the exact year but the Windows 8 sticker suggests that it is old) running Bodhi Linux 7.0. A Bodhi forum post led me to a 2018 guide for fixing screen tearing on devices with integrated Intel graphics on a site dedicated to Ubuntu MATE (link). The first step was to run inxi -G to discover information about which version of Intel graphics was in use. Fortunately, my netbook used the exact version (2nd generation) as the example, so all I had to do was some simple copying and pasting. I rebooted and the screen tearing was gone. I linked to an archived version of the guide since this should remain a great resource for fixing screen tearing on older devices with Intel integrated graphics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using an old LibreBooted ThinkPad as a "server"... really more as an always-on Syncthing node. After having some issues with GNU Trisquel (probably my fault), I decided to go with Bodhi Linux 7.0 (I prefer to have a GUI). Installation went perfect but I had an issue with the behavior on sleep. By default, the laptop seems to suspend when I close the lid, which causes wi-fi to shut off.  Since I want it to be an always-on Syncthing node, I obviously need the wi-fi to stay on when I close the laptop. After fumbling for a solution, I read on a forum that the XFCE power manager works outside of XFCE.  That sounded good to me since I use XFCE on my main workstation and I am familiar with its GUI tools. I installed it (no extra dependencies - nice), enabled it, and modified the power settings.  It worked perfectly.  I mark this issue as solved.

I took this photo on New York City's Brooklyn Bridge with my BlackBerry Classic phone camera on August 12, 2019. This photo is next to the first Manhattan pedestrian exit and close to the second. Back in 2019, the small pedestrian walkway was split between walkers and bikers (the bikes were banished to a separate path in 2021). The Bridge was difficult to navigate without NYC DOT trucks doing trash pickup in broad daylight. My photo does not capture how much it was struggling, but note that the only way around it was for walkers to go into the bike path (left side was for walkers).
