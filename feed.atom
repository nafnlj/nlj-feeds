        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read about an e-ink monitor for phones and thought the idea was interesting (as someone who wants an open source e-ink phone with a physical keyboard), but impractical. Instead of spending $300 to test a monitor (not that this was in the cards), I tried using the open source Screen Stream app on F-Droid to stream my phone screen with my feed reader to my PocketBook InkPad Color. Conclusion:  It *works* -- but there are some practical annoyances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a Nintendo Life survey of the best Nintendo controllers. I noted while reading that I had owned and used every controller except one. Somewhat improbably, the "one" is the Wii U Pro Controller, but not the Virtual Boy or NES (101) controllers. Go figure. Having determined that I have the relevant experience to weigh in, I offered my own Nintendo controller takes, but separated into categories... best non-joystick controller (SNES); best joystick controller (GCN/Switch Pro), and best joystick (N64).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search tool called Peekier in February 2022. Peekier, like many "alternative" search, was mostly a Bing front-end. However, it came with a strong, straightforward privacy policy (albeit with a bit of Cloudflare required .js to run) and a unique way of presenting search results as preview thumbnails.  However, I discovered the other day that Peekier is no more -- its URL redirects to Kagi Search as of late February.  I took a look at the demise of Peekier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search engine (or more aptly put, Bing front-end) called Peekier in February 2022. My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of uBlock Origin version 1.49.2, you can now install the extension for Mozilla Thunderbird (see release version). The extension page on Thunderbird Add-ons states that it works with Thunderbird version 91.0 and higher. I use uBlock Origin with Firefox and I also use Thunderbird as my desktop email client (see my article on using Thunderbird with DecSync). I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox. The installation and export worked perfectly, but the non-uBlock Origin filter lists that I have enabled did not update (I am not sure if that is a general issue, but not important in my case). Consider this a PSA for Thunderbird users. If you want an aesthetic Thunderbird set-up, see my short post on the Two Little Birds theme.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[uBlock Origin is now available as a Thunderbird Add-on (as of version 1.49.2). I use Thunderbird, so I installed the Add-on and imported by uBO settings from my Firefox set-up. Everything worked but for one point -- the non-uBlock Origin blocklists are not updating for me in Thunderbird (not an issue for me, but worth noting -- have not looked into why yet).

Article:
https://thenewleafjournal.com/rose-at-the-brooklyn-botanic-garden-2007/

I did not understand the value of keeping my own data back in 2007 (I was in high school way back when). I uploaded those photos to Picasa (dating myself) and my only copies were on Google Photos (I remember when Picasa transmogrified). I did Google Takeout before I cleared my photo accounts, but my 2007 photos were low res. Fortunately, I have Upscayl as a free and open source solution for restoring my low-res Google'd photos to something resembling their former glory.
