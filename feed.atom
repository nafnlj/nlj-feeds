I was going to send a guide after I remembered myself -- then I figured I ought to just publish the guide on the NLJ.  Note that I personally use Lutris (and occasionally Bottles) as a WINE GUI, but PlayOnLinux still works fairly well and is certainly the better choice for a 2007 MacBook with 1 GB of RAM running Bodhi Linux.

Note that the ranking comes with the caveat that statistics come from Koko Analytics, which is an entirely local WordPress page counter with no third party scripts or connections. It respects Do Not Track and does not work for users who block JS, so it is (by design) not as robust as commercial solutions.  However, I have found that its recording of Google referrers is usually fairly close to what I see in Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster), so I'll count it as close enough for all normal, non-creepy purposes.

I don't think anyone really read it (such is the fate of small photo posts). However, according to my local privacy-friendly analytics tool, Koko Analytics, I suddenly got a large number of referrals from Facebook (unusual, if not unprecedented) all pointing to the banana bench article. I guess someone shared it. However, I don't have Facebook, so the source will forever be a mystery. You too can enjoy the banana bench.

While I don't think I need a task management app per se, I decided to see how Zim works. I set up a new Planner notebook with the tasks and journal plugins enabled. I am getting the hang of it, but it has a neat, simple syntax out of the box. Thinking about some ways to turn it into a full-fledged planner.

https://shumplations.com/feed (translations of Japanese game developer interviews)
https://www.loc.gov/collections/global-legal-monitor/?fo=rss (summaries of legal news from around the world)
https://reason.com/people/josh-blackman/feed (legal analysis and commentary from Josh Blackman)
https://yukinu.com/feed/atom.xml (charming small web site with links to interesting sites, tech experiments, and looks at old tech)
https://feed.tedium.co (well-researched essays on a variety of topics)
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/feed (detailed essays on the anime industry and production)
htpps://perishablepress.com/feed/atom (personal website of WordPress developer Jeff Starr)
https://ai.mee.nu/feed/atom (daily tech news with strong opinions)
https://www.washingtontimes.com/rss/authors/stephen-dinan (one of the best reporters on immigration law/border issues)
https://liliputing.com/feed (news about mini PCs and mobile devices)
https://worldofmatthew.com/index.xml (essays on digital ownership and random musings)
I would also humbly recommend my own writing project, link in my profile if you're interested
I also recommend looking at Morss.it (https://morss.it/) if there is a site you want to subscribe to without a feed. It generally works very well (RSS Bridge and RSS Hub serve the same purpose if you want to self-host).]]></summary>

It is a static site feed aggregator primarily designed to go with GitHub Pages. I host one to aggregate my own writing on different sites. I think it may fit your use case because your Osmosfeed site itself outputs a single Atom feed. So, for example, if I have an Osmosfeed site that aggregates feeds 1, 2, and 3, the Osmosfeed site has a single feed which will include the three individual feeds. Mine has about 10-12 feeds and it has worked perfectly thus far with no issues. Not sure if it would have problems at higher numbers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a companion article, I told the story of the 1997 trade which netted the Pistons the #2 pick off a 50-win season in 2003. The trade, which saw the then-Vancouver Grizzlies trade a future, lightly protected first round pick, for a 35-year old Otis Thorpe nearing the end of his career (note the Grizzlies were coming off a 14-68 season) was so bad that one need not even qualify a critique of the trade with "hindsight is 20/20." Had anyone stopped and thought for a moment, all of the sights would have advised not making that trade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 2003 NBA Draft by addressing a hypothetical -- should the Detroit Pistons, who lucked into the second overall pick despite coming off a 50 win season thanks to a trade from 1997, have drafted Carmelo Anthony? As we know, the Pistons drafted Darko Milicic, who played little in 2.5 seasons with the team, but they won the 2003-04 championship. After considering all the factors, I concluded in a long, stat-filled article, that with perfect hindsight, the Pistons should not have drafted Anthony, but I do offer some alternatives.
(PS: I was proud of myself when I guessed the championship odds ranking going into 2002-03 and found that the betting odds rank on Basketball Reference matched my guess perfectly.)

For those who had a 4th of July event deferred, I present my 2021 (fictional) dialogue on the PURPOSE of July 4 grilling. As one of the three major characters in the dialogue argues -- the purpose is very clearly ritualistic sacrifices to the Founding Fathers ("argues" is the operative word).

I have published more than 800 articles and 350 short-form posts (almost all posts by me, but my friend has published 30something articles). I write about whatever interests me (I tell myself this means there is something for everyone). Common topics include, but are not limited to, tech (digital ownership, open source software, feeds, and my learning Linux), history (usually American or Roman), old books and poems, anime, visual novels (mainly English translations of freeware NScripter/KiriKiri novels), photos from my walks, fictional dialogues, and occasional commentary about life in NYC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 4, 1923, a Reverend Charles W. Lyons delivered an Independence Day oration titled "The American Mind" (the title was inspired by a Jefferson quote). In a 2021 article, I re-printed the entire oration and offered my own commentary. Having put my thoughts in the article, I submit a fun fact for Mastodon. Lyons, who was a Jesuit priest, is the only man to have served as president of four different American colleges (Gonzaga, St. Joseph's, Boston College, and Georgetown).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final thoughts:  Skip to Loafer
I was not familiar with the underlying Skip to Loafer manga when I saw a preview for the anime series, but the concept looked interesting enough.  Having finished the series, it left me a bit nonplussed.  The main character is Mitsumi Iwakura, an earnest girl from the countryside who attends high school in Tokyo to follow her dreams of becoming a politician who can revive her hometown.  Her friends play leading roles, but the co-main character is Sōsuke Shima, an attractive young man and former child actor who takes a liking to Mitsumi.  The entire series is pleasant enough, handled with care (see animation analysis) and I never considered not seeing it through to the end.  But while I have high tolerance for slow-paced shows and proverbial "slice of life* pieces, but Skip to Loafer took my tolerance a bit too far.  Mitsumi is charming, but not particularly interesting.  Souske sees some solid development in the end, but we never get to know him quite well enough to make his past engaging.  I could see a second season improving on the first with the initial character intros done, but the first, standing alone, was decent albeit forgettable.
(The opening song and animation is very good, however.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Penultimate episode thoughts:  My Clueless First Friend
My Clueless First Friend is one of the better anime series of the season. I thought that episode 12, which aired on Sunday, was the final episode. It featured the most relationship development for the 5th grade main character duo and would have been a fine place to leave off. I was surprised at the end of the episode to see that there will be a 13th and final episode with 10 years later in the title.  While my assumption is that it will be a dream episode (my understanding is that the manga is ongoing), ending with a legitimate 10-year after look would be an interesting way to conclude an anime about a 5th grade boy extending a hand to a lonely girl and becoming aware of special feelings (the clueless concept is hardly extendable as they grow older).  I'm curious to see what the finale is.  A good finale would make My Clueless First Friend a viable year-end top six candidate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ONScripter-EN issue. It seems that old al|together games with MIDI sound do not have working sound with my set-up and the 2023 ONScripter-EN builds. They do work with the 2011 version with two exceptions.
Working with 2011: Night of the Forget-Me-Nots, Visions from the Other Side
Working with neither:  Wanderers in the Sky (glitchy sound at title, the nothing), The World to Reverse -- Hallucinate (no music on Linux with any version, does work with original Windows .exe and Fluidsynth on top of WINE)
Will test My Black Cat shortly since I recall that one also has a MIDI requirement and then file an issue report on GitHub. Off the top of my head, I think he other al|together games with MIDI issues were all KiriKiri.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several of the spring 2023 anime season series have picked up in their second halves since I expressed by concerns at the half-way point that the first half of 2023 was looking bleak. One of the most interesting (and arguably the best) series of the season is Oshi no Ko, which has achieved great popularity. The series focuses on the entertainment industry in Japan, often in a gritty way. It has impressive production values, but the overall product is inconsistent. One thing it has not failed at is hitting the big moments though. The ends of episodes 1, 7, and 9 are three of the most striking moments of anime in 2023 thus far. 9 was particularly impressive. It was not a surprise when we learned that Kana Arima is a legitimately good singer, but the set-up of her music video and the reactions of her group mates was well-done enough to earn some applause. Of course, unlike my previous three anime series of the year, Oregairu S3, SSSS.Dynazenon, and Teasting Master Takagi-san S3, Oshi no Ko has not put together an entire episode up to the standard of its best scenes. But it is making me think about how much a single scene can carry an episode or how a series of stand-out scenes can define a series. This idea needs more work. It will turn into an article at some point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where such denial-of-service conditions occur, Cloudflare provides a bizarre
“one more step” page inviting the visitor to complete a reCAPTCHA to access the
site. Cloudflare claims that this is based on IP reputation, which constitutes
a fallacious equivocation of IPs and users which has been found to be highly
detrimental to Tor users in terms of the browseability of the web.
This is a good critique of Cloudflare CAPTCHAs. They are especially annoying when using a VPN (I use Mullvad) or unusual browser configurations. I wrote about how the Wayback Machine provides a good end-around the CAPTCHA deluge for pages which have been captured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a 2006 translation of a 2004 Japanese freeware visual novel called Collage last week. This one earns my clear recommendation. It is a story covering a couple of weeks in modern Japan told  from the perspective of three adults (probably in the age 28-30 range). Over the course of the story, we see how the lives of the characters are more connected than they seem. The translation reads very well and the story is clever. I also appreciated the game's visual flair and soundtrack, both of which reminded me a bit of Persona 3.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current visual novel review project, The Letter, is the 2008 translation of a 2007 Japanese visual novel called Tegami. Like most of the al|together translation projects visual novels, Tegami was written in NScripter. However, the 2007 release was its second release. The first version was created with Yuuki! Novel. I looked up Yuuki! Novel and found a couple of interesting resources:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160208042342/http://freett.com/yuukiex/yuukinovel.html (Last capture of official website, download links still work)
https://visuallyneko.wordpress.com/visual-novel-tools/yuukinovel/ (short article about)
I downloaded the latest release of Yuuki! Novel (latest being from 2005) and an English-language translation of some of its docs. File away for a future project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading through The Letter for my next al|together review. I had an interesting issue that I will document here.
Downloaded Windows installer from Insani's al|together 2008
Extracted contents of Windows .exe into a new directory
(Note: Running EndeavourOS with mainline Linux kernel)
Ran Galladite's newest build of ONScripter-EN for Linux in the directory (https://github.com/Galladite27/ONScripter-en/releases/tag/2023-06-05)
Initially had skipping and static noise in the music
Tested Kaisernet's 2011 build and had the same issue
Tested on secondary PC running Fedora and had no issue
Rebooted my workstation and then sound worked with no issue with Galladite's newest ONScripter-EN build
I don't know what the issue was -- but The Letter has a great soundtrack, so I am glad that I resolved it (somehow)
