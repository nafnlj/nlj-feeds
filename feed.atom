This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. It was not a big publishing week at The New Leaf Journal, but I produced a few articles while also continuing to work on improving the site and its sister project, The Emu Café Social. Let us begin our week-in-review.

I technically published three new articles, but one was about our cache system serving some visitors a compressed page to download instead of the normal web page for 12 hours on Thursday. Technical issue update aside, my two full articles were fairly long.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I continue to make progress on my new social publishing site, The Emu Café Social. I have two outstanding issues:
Status post error when Friends plugin is enabled and Post Kinds is disabled. This is not an immediate issue since I am using both, but any situation wherein one plugin depends on another when the plugins provide different features makes me uncomfortable.
Micropub plugin does not create an endpoint. This is minor since I do not personally plan to publish much using the Micropub endpoint, but it bothers me. I will need to investigate since I am unsure of the issue. I confirmed IndieAuth, on which Micropub depends, does work.
No other major issues at the moment. My ActivityPub profiles briefly stopped working, but I think I fixed that by ensuring that WP Super Cache does not cache author pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across a WordPress plugin called Post Type Switcher. Description:
This plugin adds a simple post-type drop-down to the post editor interface, allowing you to reassign any post to a new post type. It allows you to switch post’s type while editing your post.
It supports custom post types. This may come in handy down the line, so I am saving it here as a proverbial bookmark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The boy-Emperor Romulus Augustulus is often described as the last (Western) Roman Emperor. He abdicated the royal purple to Odoacer on September 4, 476. But there remained another claimant to the title of Western Roman Emperor -- the exiled Julius Nepos, who lived until 480. Who was the last Western Roman Emperor? One year to the day, I wrote an article on this ultimately unimportant question.

It was successful at a baseline level but I found that things like setting security headers via .htaccess were not working.

This newsletter comes to you as always from the waterproof keyboard of the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. August is in the books, but I stepped up our publishing pace after a few slow weeks to bring the month to a proper conclusion.
