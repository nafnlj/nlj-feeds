        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a Nintendo Life survey of the best Nintendo controllers. I noted while reading that I had owned and used every controller except one. Somewhat improbably, the "one" is the Wii U Pro Controller, but not the Virtual Boy or NES (101) controllers. Go figure. Having determined that I have the relevant experience to weigh in, I offered my own Nintendo controller takes, but separated into categories... best non-joystick controller (SNES); best joystick controller (GCN/Switch Pro), and best joystick (N64).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search tool called Peekier in February 2022. Peekier, like many "alternative" search, was mostly a Bing front-end. However, it came with a strong, straightforward privacy policy (albeit with a bit of Cloudflare required .js to run) and a unique way of presenting search results as preview thumbnails.  However, I discovered the other day that Peekier is no more -- its URL redirects to Kagi Search as of late February.  I took a look at the demise of Peekier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search engine (or more aptly put, Bing front-end) called Peekier in February 2022. My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.]]></summary>

The extension page on Thunderbird Add-ons states that it works with Thunderbird version 91.0 and higher. I use uBlock Origin with Firefox and I also use Thunderbird as my desktop email client (see my article on using Thunderbird with DecSync). I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox. The installation and export worked perfectly, but the non-uBlock Origin filter lists that I have enabled did not update (I am not sure if that is a general issue, but not important in my case). Consider this a PSA for Thunderbird users. If you want an aesthetic Thunderbird set-up, see my short post on the Two Little Birds theme.]]></summary>

Article:
https://thenewleafjournal.com/rose-at-the-brooklyn-botanic-garden-2007/

I did not understand the value of keeping my own data back in 2007 (I was in high school way back when). I uploaded those photos to Picasa (dating myself) and my only copies were on Google Photos (I remember when Picasa transmogrified). I did Google Takeout before I cleared my photo accounts, but my 2007 photos were low res. Fortunately, I have Upscayl as a free and open source solution for restoring my low-res Google'd photos to something resembling their former glory.

I resize photos (usually such that the largest dimension is 800 px) for publication in The New Leaf Journal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have watched the first few episodes of a currently airing anime series called My Love Story With Yamada-kun at Lv999. While I have not been impressed thus far, it did inspire an article. The first episode begins with the viewpoint protagonist, Akane, in the dumps after her boyfriend left her for another woman he met in an online game that he played with Akane. There is a scene where Akane opens up her laptop to log into the game. When she turns it on, I noticed a problem.
Her relationship with her cad of an ex-boyfriend may be over, but her toxic relationship with Windows continues. I suggest she consider a new relationship with Linux.

(Can neither confirm nor deny possibility that Microsoft de-indexing my site from Bing played a role in inspiring this article.)

De-indexed from Bing (1.17.23)
Bing de-indexing update (1.18.23)
The Bing blacklisting not only persists, but has also become worse. I discovered in the Bing Webmaster Console that all of The New Leaf Journal's pages had been purged from Bing's index.
I subscribe to an RSS feed for Hacker News Page 1 in my feed reader. I saw an article titled Bing Jail a few days ago which caught my attention. In that post, a webmaster described his Bing blacklisting experience. I found that it was almost identical to my experience, right down to his site having been blacklisted in January 2023 and his pages being removed from Bing's index in March. He noted that several other …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, the older model had a 1 GHz dual-core processor, while the new version has a 1.8 GHz quad-core chip. Since the company is tight-lipped about exactly which processors are powering these devices, it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but it sure sounds like the new model should be a bit more responsive.Both models have just 1GB of RAM, but the original InkPad Color had just 16GB of built-in storage, while the new model has twice as much. That said, it seems like the company might have omitted one feature when building the new model: there’s no longer a microSD card reader.
I have the original PocketBook InkPad color and I generally like it. Most of the improvements in V2 would be welcome (albeit well short of prompting me to upgrade), but dropping the microSD card slot is a bad move.  The article suggests that this may have been done to increase the tablet's water resistance, but I will take the SD card over being able to submerge my e-reader in 2 meters of water.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New Leaf Journal was blacklisted from appearing in Bing's search results on January 14 and then fully removed from Bing's index in March.  The reasons for our blacklisting/de-indexing appear to be unknown to every other search engine with its own index, including Google, Brave, Mojeek, Yandex, Seznam, InfoTiger, and Marginalia... only Bing.  I read an article by a different webmaster who described almost identical Bing problems.  That post inspired me to chronicle our ongoing Bing ban.  (Note:  The worst effect has not been Bing itself, but losing DuckDuckGo, from which we received many more referrals than Bing).
