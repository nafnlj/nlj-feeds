        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the 129th edition of The Newsletter Leaf Journal, the official newsletter of the perennially virid online writing magazine, The New Leaf Journal. This newsletter comes to you as always from the editor of The New Leaf Journal, Nicholas A. Ferrell. We recently had our Saturday newsletters fall on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve just a few months ago. Today we land on April Fools. While I published a few articles about olden April Fools pranks in 2021 and 2022, I am not much of an April Fools person myself. Thus, you can enjoy your regular newsletter content without fearing a prank, but I will have some April Fools-related links for your weekend reading.
