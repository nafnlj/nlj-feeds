        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search tool called Peekier in February 2022. Peekier, like many "alternative" search, was mostly a Bing front-end. However, it came with a strong, straightforward privacy policy (albeit with a bit of Cloudflare required .js to run) and a unique way of presenting search results as preview thumbnails.  However, I discovered the other day that Peekier is no more -- its URL redirects to Kagi Search as of late February.  I took a look at the demise of Peekier.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I reviewed a niche search engine (or more aptly put, Bing front-end) called Peekier in February 2022. My Peekier review turned out to be a relatively successful post (by The New Leaf Journal's standards). The last time I had used Peekier before May 2, 2023, was in mid-January of 2023. This is because I have generally refrained from using Bing-based search after Bing arbitrarily blacklisted my project and removed it from its index. I ran a search through Peekier on May 2 as part of my day job working on U.S. immigration law research. My Peekier search unexpectedly redirected to the home page for Kagi Search. After determining that Peekier was indeed dead, I wrote an article on Peekier's demise and then updated my Peekier review to note that the charming little search tool is no more. While I am not certain of the circumstances of Peekier's downfall or why it now redirects to Kagi Search, the last Internet Archive capture of Peekier's home page came on February 19, 2023. The next capture on February 26, 2023, shows the Kagi Search redirect was in place.]]></summary>

The extension page on Thunderbird Add-ons states that it works with Thunderbird version 91.0 and higher. I use uBlock Origin with Firefox and I also use Thunderbird as my desktop email client (see my article on using Thunderbird with DecSync). I installed uBlock Origin on Thunderbird and restored my settings from my set-up on Firefox. The installation and export worked perfectly, but the non-uBlock Origin filter lists that I have enabled did not update (I am not sure if that is a general issue, but not important in my case). Consider this a PSA for Thunderbird users. If you want an aesthetic Thunderbird set-up, see my short post on the Two Little Birds theme.]]></summary>

Article:
https://thenewleafjournal.com/rose-at-the-brooklyn-botanic-garden-2007/

I did not understand the value of keeping my own data back in 2007 (I was in high school way back when). I uploaded those photos to Picasa (dating myself) and my only copies were on Google Photos (I remember when Picasa transmogrified). I did Google Takeout before I cleared my photo accounts, but my 2007 photos were low res. Fortunately, I have Upscayl as a free and open source solution for restoring my low-res Google'd photos to something resembling their former glory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have watched the first few episodes of a currently airing anime series called My Love Story With Yamada-kun at Lv999. While I have not been impressed thus far, it did inspire an article. The first episode begins with the viewpoint protagonist, Akane, in the dumps after her boyfriend left her for another woman he met in an online game that he played with Akane. There is a scene where Akane opens up her laptop to log into the game. When she turns it on, I noticed a problem.
Her relationship with her cad of an ex-boyfriend may be over, but her toxic relationship with Windows continues. I suggest she consider a new relationship with Linux.

(Can neither confirm nor deny possibility that Microsoft de-indexing my site from Bing played a role in inspiring this article.)

Bing de-indexing update (1.18.23)
The Bing blacklisting not only persists, but has also become worse. I discovered in the Bing Webmaster Console that all of The New Leaf Journal's pages had been purged from Bing's index.
I subscribe to an RSS feed for Hacker News Page 1 in my feed reader. I saw an article titled Bing Jail a few days ago which caught my attention. In that post, a webmaster described his Bing blacklisting experience. I found that it was almost identical to my experience, right down to his site having been blacklisted in January 2023 and his pages being removed from Bing's index in March. He noted that several other …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, the older model had a 1 GHz dual-core processor, while the new version has a 1.8 GHz quad-core chip. Since the company is tight-lipped about exactly which processors are powering these devices, it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but it sure sounds like the new model should be a bit more responsive.Both models have just 1GB of RAM, but the original InkPad Color had just 16GB of built-in storage, while the new model has twice as much. That said, it seems like the company might have omitted one feature when building the new model: there’s no longer a microSD card reader.
I have the original PocketBook InkPad color and I generally like it. Most of the improvements in V2 would be welcome (albeit well short of prompting me to upgrade), but dropping the microSD card slot is a bad move.  The article suggests that this may have been done to increase the tablet's water resistance, but I will take the SD card over being able to submerge my e-reader in 2 meters of water.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The New Leaf Journal was blacklisted from appearing in Bing's search results on January 14 and then fully removed from Bing's index in March.  The reasons for our blacklisting/de-indexing appear to be unknown to every other search engine with its own index, including Google, Brave, Mojeek, Yandex, Seznam, InfoTiger, and Marginalia... only Bing.  I read an article by a different webmaster who described almost identical Bing problems.  That post inspired me to chronicle our ongoing Bing ban.  (Note:  The worst effect has not been Bing itself, but losing DuckDuckGo, from which we received many more referrals than Bing).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1954 years to the day (April 16, 69 AD), the Roman Emperor Otho ended his brief reign by his own hand rather than continue in a Civil War for the throne against Vilettlius. Otho's seemingly noble(-ish) end captured the imagination of Roman historians in light of the fact he had previously been noted for his relationship to Nero, having serious debt problems, and seizing the throne by murdering his predecessor in January 69.  I wrote a very long article about the enigmatic life and death of Otho, focusing on comparing four Roman historian accounts and their different opinions on the matter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shawn Respert was one of the best college basketball players of the early 90s, winning NCAA player of the year in 1995. After going 8th overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, he had a short, uneventful, five-year career with four different teams. While college success by no means guarantees professional success, some of Respert's troubles were linked to the fact he was diagnosed with stomach cancer during his first season (he went into remission in his second season).  What prompted my article was the story of his response. Respert opted to keep his diagnosis secret, not only from the public, but also from his family -- even when he was being criticized in local media for his poor play.  He resolved to only tell his story after his playing career was over in order to ensure that no one could say, succeed or fail, that he made any excuses (to be sure, he had a decent one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the Ghostwriter markdown editor (see my Ghostwriter review) to draft articles for The New Leaf Journal and briefs and memoranda for my day job as a legal research specialist. In both cases, I have to convert my documents from markdown. I convert New Leaf Journal articles to .odt for editing while I convert my legal work to to .docx. (See my article on my New Leaf Journal workflow.)
Since switching to Linux in 2020, I have used Arch-based Linux distributions. I began using Ghostwriter on Manjaro after my experiences using markdown to compose 
our Buttondown-powered newsletters inspired me to begin working in markdown. I moved from Manjaro to Arch's closer cousin, EndeavourOS, in August 2022, where I remain today.
Ghostwriter has generally worked for me without issues. Early on, I had an issue with it sometimes not connecting to Pandoc, but that went away at some point. Since KDE took over development of Ghostwriter things were largely flawless. However, a few days ago, I noticed after updating either Pandoc or KDE (I did not catch which) that Ghostwriter was no longer recognizing Pandoc as a conversion option. This was a mild problem for me because I never took the time to learn the Pandoc CLI syntax (I really should get around to that). I could use MultiMarkdown to convert to .odt, but that vitiated many of my markdown formatting choices.
However, before I had to deal with the issue for a work project, Pandoc returned as a conversion option after something was updated. Problem solved. It only proved to be a pain in the case of one somewhat long article wherein I had to re-do some of my formatting in Libre Office Writer.
If you enjoy strange Ghostwriter issues, take a trip back in time to learn about a segfault issue I had on a fresh Manjaro install in 2021.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a 2019 interview, a representative of the Czech-based Seznam search engine (interesting Czech-based project with its own crawler) discussed the challenges of indexing English-language sites due to the fact that many block all crawlers except Google.  Being a supporter of independent search indexes, I wrote a brief PSA for webmasters on the subject of allowing independent search engines with their own crawlers.  In addition to Seznam, I singled out @Mojeek , InfoTiger, and Marginalia Search as being worth whitelisting for sites with generally restrictive robots.txt rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tagline of my main project, The New Leaf Journal, is "where the leaves are perennially virid." As I explained in a post on the inspiration for the tagline, the slogan gets at two ideas. The first is that I try to write evergreen articles. The second is that I try to produce unique articles worth your time. There is no shortage of writing online. Some of the writing even comes from the keyboards of human beings writing in a language they are fluent in. While I try to bring a fresh perspective to all of my articles, I cannot always say that my topics are unique. However, I published a short "leaflet" aside yesterday which I think is unique.

In that post, I collected English-language sources on a certain legend that Natsume Sōseki had suggested "tsuki ga kirei" (the Moon is beautiful) as a Japanese translation for "I love you." I had learned about the tsuki ga kirei legend from the excellent 2017 anime series (it featured in my decade review, Tsuki ga Kirei, and while it is likely a work of fiction (I knew that going into my research project), the phrase is aesthetically elegant.

Unsurprisingly given my small number of posts and the fact that I tend to reserve my best content for The New Leaf Journal (I largely leave quality determinations to others), I only have a handful of Bear Blog readers. From this small sample, I have noted that a majority of my readers are based in Romania. Nearly all of the referrals are from Bear Blog (not surprising). Are there a large number of Bear Blog users and readers in Romania or are people using VPNs? The sample size is too small for me to make much of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My review of Shooting Star Hill, the official English version of the freeware 2005 Japanese visual novel, Hoshi no Furu Oka. It tells the story of a lonely (alien?) girl and the boy who wants to befriend her.  I enjoyed Shooting Star Hill and it is one of the better entries from the review project that I am doing. It takes about one hour to read and remains free to download and run. Linux users should either run the Windows version under WINE or replace the old Linux ONScripter-EN executable that comes with the game with the most recent build (links and instructions in article).
(Note: I should really replace those old screenshots with borderless screenshots... someday.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post, I offered my very early impressions of a free and open source Android feed reader and read-it-later app called Handy Reading. My early impressions were very favorable because, by combining feed reading and read-it-later into a local app, it perfectly suits my reading-flow (see my post on combining feeds with a read-it-later solution). However, I had one pressing issue with Handy Reading:
Handy Reading re-fetches old, previously seen articles from a small number of feeds, which is a bit annoying.
Two days later, I think that I have tentatively resolved the issue. By default, Handy Reading has a short "keep old articles" time. It seems that if a feed is offering old articles outside the scope of Handy Reading's kept article time, it will re-fetch those old articles and display them is new even if you have already marked them as read in the app. Fortunately, Handy Reading allows you to set the keep old articles period on a feed-by-feed basis. I have been doing that with the offending feeds and so far the results have been good.
Provided no new issues pop up, I will try a few additional features of Handy Reading before proceeding to a review. One issue that I am particularly interested in is testing its import/export functionality, since that proved to be an issue with my previous solution -- Flym DecSync. I recently talked to one Mastodon user who reported that Handy Reading does not handle Mastodon feeds, which is true. While I hope this is fixed, it is not a priority for me since I do not use my feed reader for social feeds.]]></summary>
